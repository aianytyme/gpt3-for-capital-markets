4. The Settlement arises out of the Actions alleging breaches of fiduciary duty, among other claims, against certain current and former officers and directors of Pinterest. Plaintiffs alleged that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with, among other things, (1) a pattern of employment discrimination and retaliation by certain executives at the Company; (2) failures of oversight by the Board; (3) waste of corporate assets, abuse of control, and unjust enrichment; and (4) a violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
5. The Individual Defendants deny the allegations made by Plaintiffs in the Actions.
The Actions
6. In November and December 2020, Plaintiffs filed three shareholder derivative complaints on behalf of nominal defendant Pinterest: Bushansky, No. 3:20-cv-08331-WHA;
Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, No. 3:20-cv-08438-WHA; and Toronto, No. 3:20-cv-09390-WHA. Prior to filing a lawsuit, each plaintiff served a books and records demand on the Company pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 (“Section 220”) and received and reviewed relevant documents. On February 19, 2021, the Court consolidated these three cases and appointed an 3 interim leadership structure. On February 26, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”), asserting claims for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) waste of corporate assets, (3) abuse of control, (4) unjust enrichment, and (5) violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9. The Consolidated Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have standing to bring the shareholder derivative claims because a demand on Pinterest’s Board would have been futile.
7. On April 22, 2021, Pinterest moved to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.1 on the grounds that Plaintiffs had failed to
adequately allege that demand would have been futile. The Individual Defendants filed a joinder, arguing that the Consolidated Complaint should also be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On May 27, 2021, Plaintiffs opposed Pinterest’s motion to dismiss.
8. Pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, on June 1, 2021, the Court referred the case to the Northern District of California ADR Program, appointed Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph C. Spero as Special Master, and postponed the filing of Defendants’ reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss while the parties engaged in the mediation process before Judge Spero. 
9. On July 14, 2021, another shareholder derivative complaint was filed. Petretta v. Silbermann, No. 3:21-cv-05385-WHA. On July 19, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed notice of
consolidation of related case. On October 6, 2021, the Court consolidated the Petretta action into the Federal Consolidated Action. On October 31, 2021, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint.
10. On November 21, 2021, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, and the Court entered a Preliminary Approval Order on February 16, 2022.

On March 19, 2022, the Court entered an Order granting preliminary approval of the Settlement and scheduled a final approval hearing for May 26, 2022.
11.

The Special Master will make a recommendation to the Court.
12. The Settlement is subject to the Court’s approval.
