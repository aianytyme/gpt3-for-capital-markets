While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.  For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model.  GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans.  We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.\\n\\n## Contents\\n- [175b_samples.jsonl](175b_samples.jsonl) - Unconditional, unfiltered 2048 token samples from GPT-3 with p=.85, t=1.&#12288;\\n**CONTENT WARNING:** GPT-3 was trained on arbitrary data from the web, so may contain offensive content and language.\\n- [data](data) - Synthetic datasets for word scramble and arithmetic tasks described in the paper.\\n- [dataset_statistics](dataset_statistics) - Statistics for all languages included in the training dataset mix.\\n- [overlap_frequency.md](overlap_frequency.md) - Samples of 13-gram overlaps between our training data and benchmarks, selected by frequency in the training set.\\n- [model-card.md](model-card.md) - GPT-3 Model Card.\\n\\n## How to cite\\n```\\n@article{brown2020language,\\n    title={Language Models are Few-Shot Learners},\\n    author={Tom B.
