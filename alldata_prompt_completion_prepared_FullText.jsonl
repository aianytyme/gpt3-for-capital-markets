{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1. Business  The Company is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2000. MGT was originally incorporated in Utah in 1977. MGT is comprised of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary MGT Sweden AB. MGTs corporate office is in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Cryptocurrency Mining Business  Industry Summary  Bitcoin is a world-recognized cryptocurrency, which can be traded and converted into major fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a decentralized distributed ledger system, called the Blockchain. The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to the Blockchain. The processing power used to solve these mathematical problems is measured by Hash Rate or Hashes per second  H s . The complexity of these problems, also referred to as mining difficulty, increases with the networks growing Hash Rate.  Bitcoin mining entails solving these complex mathematical problems using custom designed and programmed application-specific integrated circuit  ASIC  computers  also referred to as miners . Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees.  Additional information about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be found on publicly available educational sources such as www.Bitcoin.org.  Our Operations  Cryptocurrency mining  Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts  MW  of low-cost power.  The Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company  Bitmain , and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Companys miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Companys current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW. The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is presently using only a portion of the built-out available electrical load, it is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners.  Prior to establishing our Company-owned and managed facility, we conducted our Bitcoin mining operations through third-party hosting arrangements. We also entered into management agreements with third party investors whereby the investors purchased the mining hardware, and we received both a fee to manage the mining operations plus one-half of the net operating profit. In March 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to terminate our hosting agreement in Washington and conveyed ownership of its onsite mining assets for full satisfaction of  77 in outstanding hosting service fees. In August and September 2019, we terminated all our management agreements with third party investors, and in December 2019, we terminated our final remaining hosting arrangements in Colorado and Ohio.  Bitcoin And Blockchain Overview   A Bitcoin is one type of a digital asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security  the Bitcoin Network . The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public Blockchain transaction ledger and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, at rates determined on Bitcoin exchanges or in individual peer to peer end-user-to-end-user transactions.  Bitcoins are stored or reflected on the Blockchain in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all Bitcoin in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each Bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns it. The Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact Bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network.  The Bitcoin Network, being decentralized, does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoin. Rather, Bitcoin are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a mining process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin exchange market  and in private peer to peer transactions , as well as the number of merchants that accept it. As Bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any users Bitcoin software and Bitcoin can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are only minor transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third party service providers such as Bitcoin exchanges and third party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, Bitcoin to or from fiat currency.  Miners dedicate substantial resources to mining. Given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the Bitcoin Network, miners must continually invest in expensive mining hardware to achieve adequate processing power to hash at a competitive rate.  Bitcoin is an example of a digital asset that is not a fiat currency  i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization  and are not backed by hard assets or other credit. As a result, the value of Bitcoin is determined by the value that various market participants place on Bitcoin through their transactions.  The supply of Bitcoin is finite. Once 21 million Bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are approximately 19 million Bitcoin in circulation, or 90  of the total supply of Bitcoin. Within the Bitcoin protocol is an event referred to as Bitcoin halving  Halving  where the Bitcoin provided upon mining a block is reduced by 50 . Halvings are scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, until the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin is reached. The most recent Halving occurred in May 2020, with a revised reward payout of 6.25 Bitcoin per block.  Given a stable hash rate, a Halving reduces the number of new Bitcoin being generated by the network. While the effect is to limit the supply of new coins, it has no impact on the quantity of total Bitcoin outstanding. As a result, the price of Bitcoin could rise or fall based on overall investor and consumer demand. Should the price of Bitcoin remain unchanged after the next Halving, the Companys revenue would be reduced by 50 , with a much larger negative impact to profit.  The cryptocurrency markets have grown rapidly in both popularity and market size. These markets are local, national and international and include an ever-broadening range of products and participants. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission  the SEC , and other governmental agencies around the world, are evaluating the cryptocurrency markets and are likely to institute new rules and regulations within this market to protect investors and such regulations could result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading of our common stock.  Strategy  MGTs strategy is to oversee the operation of its Bitcoin miners in La Fayette, Georgia. The Companys immediate focus is to grow free cash flow, with a longer-term objective to expand its mining operation.  Competition  Our industry is extremely new and subject to rapid change and constant innovation. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models. Some of these companies are our suppliers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain personnel, educated and skilled in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency mining space.  We compete with vertically integrated companies such as Bitfury Group Limited and Bitmain Technologies LTD that engage in both the design and distribution of mining machines, as well as cryptocurrency mining. We also compete with many other companies that are engaged in cryptocurrency mining, some of which may have lower operating costs or cost of capital than MGT.  Employees  Currently, the Company and its subsidiary have 2 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.

Our Healthcare segment competes against Optum, Amazon, Google, 3M, Phillips, and other smaller competitors. Our Enterprise segment competes against [24]7, Amazon, Genesys, Google, LivePerson, Salesforce, and Pindrop, among other less frequent competitors. Additionally, a number of smaller companies in voice recognition, natural language understanding, and text input offer technologies or products that are competitive with our solutions.  Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with other parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers.  Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do.  Employees  Our success as a company is made possible by our employees. We must attract, develop, and retain exceptional talent to meet the needs of our customers and create value for our stockholders. Our human capital management strategy is therefore of critical importance to the success of our company. This strategy is built on three key pillars   1  Inclusion and Diversity,  2  Supporting our Employees, and  3  Growing and Developing our Talent.  As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 6,900 full-time employees, including approximately 1,000 in sales and marketing, approximately 2,800 in hosting and maintenance and support services, approximately 700 in professional services, approximately 1,700 in R D, and approximately 700 in general and administrative. Approximately 41  of our employees are based outside of the U.S. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by a labor union. Employees of certain foreign subsidiaries are represented by labor unions or workers councils.  Inclusion and Diversity  Nuances AI solutions transform the way we connect and interact with each other, and that starts with a culture where everyone feels welcome, heard, and valued. Our team is stronger when our many diverse perspectives are celebrated - thats how we deliver the best solutions for our company and our customers.  We are committed to inclusion and diversity at Nuance, and our management team is focused on fulfilling this commitment. We pay close attention to our diversity metrics to ensure we are making progress toward our goals. We measure gender, ethnicity, and age diversity, and our executive team reviews and discusses these metrics regularly. Nuance is also committed to pay equity and providing equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We conduct pay-equity reviews to ensure we remain compliant and vigilant in providing fair pay.  At Nuance, we are focused on fostering a dynamic, diverse and inclusive workplace where each individual is celebrated for being themselves. We know that hiring people with diverse backgrounds and skillsets is a key ingredient for innovation, which is why our recruitment processes are built around improving our ability to identify the best, most diverse candidate pools. We ensure gender-neutral language in job descriptions and commit to bringing a diverse slate of candidates to a diverse interview panel at all levels of the company. We are also committed to creating an environment where our employees thrive both personally and professionally and creating opportunities for ongoing learning and dialogues that support an inclusive, diverse, and equitable culture.  Supporting our Employees  The physical and mental well-being of our employees and their families is a key priority, and we continue to expand our global benefits offerings to support our employees at every stage of their lives. We have specifically focused on ways to support our employees and their families through our policies, benefits, resources, and programs. Some examples of this include a global parental leave of 12 weeks, a phase back to work program for new parents, enhanced medical, dental, and vision plans, and significant enhancements to our family leave and bereavement policies to ensure our employees are able to take the time they need to take care of themselves and their loved ones. We have a variety of tools and resources for our employees to provide as much support as possible while working in changed and challenging circumstances, including providing our global employees access to a free premium subscription to a meditation app, along with various mental health resources. We provide a membership to an online marketplace to help our US employees to find child and elder care along with subsidized back up child elder days. We also provide student loan refinancing support. Nuance continues to provide access to free employee assistance plans   EAP   globally, mental health sessions, work life balance support sessions, virtual yoga and fitness classes,  and we have hosted a variety of virtual sessions for the family such as cooking demos, mindfulness for kids, and financial wellness.  Growing and Developing our Talent  We believe our technology is only as brilliant as the people who create it. From interns to executives, we encourage and support our employees to be life-long learners. By equipping our employees with tools and resources, and fostering an environment focused on personal and professional growth, we empower them to evolve our solutions and to work towards their unique career goals.  We know our best source of development and learning is each other - and we have created a variety of programs for our employees to support their development. Our global mentoring program, Mentoring Matters, allows employees to select mentors that share similar interests or have an area of expertise they wish to learn and develop in their current and future roles at Nuance. Additionally, we host monthly development workshops and product sessions with internal leaders and subject matter experts, publish monthly career development newsletters with information and resources for employees to expand their skillsets, and encourage our employees to use our multiple third-party learning platforms.  We are also focused on ensuring our people leaders have the resources and skills they need to be effective, support their teams, and deliver on the expectations we have of our managers at Nuance. This begins with our Manager Academy program, designed for all new and existing people managers to ensure that are supported and enabled to lead their teams. Our Leadership Academy, designed for mid- to senior-level leaders, is focused on delivering curated content and workshops tailored to their individual needs. Finally, Nuance sponsors a diverse group of senior leaders across the company to participate in a Harvard-sponsored executive leadership consortium. This consortium helps organizations accelerate leadership impact and build a diverse network of executives through a bespoke curriculum of business and leadership skills that enhance self-awareness, build confidence leading teams, and broaden the command of the business.  Information About Geographic Areas  We have offices in a number of international locations including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, and the U.K. The responsibilities of our international operations include research and development, customer support, sales and marketing and general and administrative. Additionally, we maintain smaller sales, services and support offices throughout the world to support our international customers and to expand international revenue opportunities.  Geographic revenue classification is based on the geographic areas in which our customers are located. For fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, 80 , 79  and 80  of revenue from continuing operations was generated in the U.S. and 20 , 21  and 20  was generated by our international customers, respectively.  Corporate Information and Website  We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1992. Our website is located at www.nuance.com and we trade under the ticker symbol NUAN. We are not including the information contained in our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this annual report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge through our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these materials with, or otherwise furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission   SEC  ."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A.Risk Factors  You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below when evaluating the company and when deciding whether to invest in the company. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe are important to an investor may also harm our business operations. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or our results of operations could be seriously harmed. If that happens, the trading price of our common stock could decline.  Risks Related to Our Business  Our liquidity, operations, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the novel coronavirus  COVID-19 .  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. While we have not experienced significant disruptions to our ability to conduct business thus far as a result of the pandemic, we are currently conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications.  The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact our business, operations, and financial results in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including   the duration and scope of the pandemic;  governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity;  the actions taken in response to economic disruption;  the impact of business disruptions on our customers and partners and the resulting impact on their demand for our products and services;  our customers and partners ability to pay for our products and services; and  our ability to provide our products and services, including as a result of our employees working remotely and or closures of offices and facilities.  We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assessing its potential effects on our business. Many of our customers are hospitals and other healthcare providers that are facing capital shortages and other changes to their businesses as they focus on fighting the pandemic. As a result, in particular with respect to our healthcare customers, our net new sales may be lower than expected; our ability to recognize revenue may be negatively impacted due to implementation delays, decreased utilization of certain products such as our PowerScribe and DAX solutions, decrease in volumes where we have transaction-based revenue, or other factors; our collections may be delayed, which will negatively affect our cash flows; some customers may go out of business, and we will be unsecured creditors and may not be able to collect what we are owed; our ability to provide 24x7 worldwide support to our customers may be affected; and our employees productivity may be negatively impacted as a result of almost all of our workforce working from home. The pandemic and accompanying market volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational changes we have made in response cannot be accurately predicted at this time.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully.  There are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in our targeted markets. The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers, and frequent new product introductions, including alternatives for certain of our products that offer limited functionality at significantly lower costs or free of charge. Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers. Furthermore, there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions.  The competition in our targeted markets could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products and solutions we license or sell or the prices we can charge. Some of our current or potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, and in certain cases may be able to include or combine their competitive products or technologies with other of their products or technologies in a manner whereby the competitive functionality is available at lower cost or free of charge within the larger offering. To the extent they do so, market acceptance and penetration of our products, and therefore our revenue and bookings, may be adversely affected. Our success depends substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological  enhancements. If we are unable to develop or acquire new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes our business will suffer.  Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause our stock price to decline.  Our revenue, bookings and operating results have fluctuated materially in the past and we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future. These fluctuations may cause our results of operations not to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which would likely cause the price of our stock to decline. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in operating results include   volume, timing and fulfillment of customer orders and receipt of royalty reports;  fluctuating sales by our channel partners to their customers;  customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new versions of our products;  contractual counterparties failing to meet their contractual commitments to us;  introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  cybersecurity or data breaches;  seasonality in purchasing patterns of our customers;  reduction in the prices of our products in response to competition, market conditions or contractual obligations;  returns and allowance charges in excess of accrued amounts;  timing of significant marketing and sales promotions;  impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;  the pace of the transition to an on-demand and transactional revenue model;  delayed realization of synergies resulting from our acquisitions;  accounts receivable that are not collectible and write-offs of excess or obsolete inventory;  increased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities;  higher than anticipated costs related to fixed-price contracts with our customers;  change in costs due to regulatory or trade restrictions;  expenses incurred in litigation matters, whether initiated by us or brought by third parties against us, and settlements or judgments we are required to pay in connection with disputes; and  general economic trends as they affect the customer bases into which we sell.  Due to the foregoing factors, among others, our revenue, bookings and operating results are difficult to forecast. Our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenue, and we may not be able to reduce our expenses quickly to respond to near-term shortfalls in projected revenue. Therefore, our failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.  A significant portion of our revenue and bookings are derived, and a significant portion of our research and development activities are based, outside the United States. Our results could be harmed by economic, political, regulatory, foreign currency fluctuation and other risks associated with these international regions.  Because we operate worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We generate most of our international revenue and bookings in Canada and Europe, and we anticipate that revenue and bookings from international operations could increase in the future. In addition, some of our products are developed outside the United States and we have a large number of employees in India who provide transcription and development services, and we also have a large number of employees in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom who provide professional services. We conduct a significant portion of the development of our voice recognition and natural language understanding solutions in Canada and Germany. We also have significant research and development resources in Austria, Belgium, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies including the Euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Indian rupee. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations, including   adverse political and economic conditions, or changes to such conditions, in a specific region or country;  trade protection measures, including tariffs and import export controls, imposed by the United States and or by other countries or regional authorities such as Canada or the European Union;  the impact on local and global economies of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union;  changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the lack of ability to hedge certain foreign currencies;  compliance with laws and regulations in many countries and any subsequent changes in such laws and regulations;  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war;  changing data privacy regulations and customer requirements to locate data centers in certain jurisdictions;  evolving restrictions on cross-border investment, including recent enhancements to the oversight by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Preview Modernization Act;  changes in applicable tax laws;  difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries;  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions; and  less effective protection of intellectual property outside the United States.  If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be harmed.  To execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. If any of our key employees were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Although we have arrangements with some of our executive officers designed to promote retention, our employment relationships are generally at-will and we have had key employees leave in the past. We cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software, as well as for skilled information technology, marketing, sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and difficulty in retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, we have experienced a competitive hiring environment in the Greater Boston area, where we are headquartered. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. If the price of our stock declines, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees will be adversely affected. We intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, including research and development and operational personnel, but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm our business.  Cybersecurity and data privacy incidents or breaches may damage client relations and inhibit our growth.  The confidentiality and security of our information, and that of third parties, is critical to our business. Our services involve the transmission, use, and storage of our customers and their customers' confidential information. We were the victim of a cybercrime in 2017, and future cybersecurity or data privacy incidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. While we maintain a broad array of information security and privacy measures, policies and practices, our networks may be breached through a variety of means, resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our information, to information of our customers or their customers, or to our intellectual property; disabling or degrading service; or sabotaging systems or information. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors, and vendors. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We will continue to incur significant costs to continuously enhance our information security measures to defend against the threat of cybercrime. Any cybersecurity or data privacy incident or breach may result in   loss of revenue resulting from the operational disruption;  loss of revenue or increased bad debt expense due to the inability to invoice properly or to customer dissatisfaction resulting in collection issues;  loss of revenue due to loss of customers;  material remediation costs to restore systems;  material investments in new or enhanced systems in order to enhance our information security posture;  cost of incentives offered to customers to restore confidence and maintain business relationships;  reputational damage resulting in the failure to retain or attract customers;  costs associated with potential litigation or governmental investigations;  costs associated with any required notices of a data breach;  costs associated with the potential loss of critical business data; and  other consequences of which we are not currently aware but will discover through the remediation process.  Our business is subject to a variety of domestic and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations including data protection, anticorruption and health care reimbursement.  We must comply with, numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters such as data privacy and protection, anticorruption, employment and labor relations, tax, foreign currency, anti-competition, import export controls, trade regulations, immigration, anti-kickback laws and healthcare reimbursement laws. The global nature of our operations increases the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these laws in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and or our employees, prohibitions on doing business, breach of contract damages and harm to our reputation.  In particular, we are subject to a complex array of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and personal health information, with additional laws applicable in some jurisdictions depending on the type of data collected or where the information is collected from children. In many cases, these laws apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between us and our subsidiaries. Many of the laws passed in this area are relatively new and their interpretation is evolving and changing. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act   CCPA  , went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA imposes privacy and data security obligations on companies and provides California consumers with certain rights as data subjects. Several other U.S. states have proposed data privacy laws that impose similar but non-identical obligations. In addition, some states have passed laws imposing increased data security and breach notification obligations on companies operating in the U.S. In the EU, the European General Data Protection Regulation  the GDPR , which went into effect in May 2018, imposes privacy and data security compliance obligations and significant penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR presents numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including rights guaranteed to data subjects, requirements for data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements and significant fines for noncompliance. In GDPR enforcement matters, companies have faced fines for violations of certain provisions. Fines can reach as high as 4  of a companys annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of a companys international affiliates. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, a mechanism that companies had previously relied on to transfer information between the EU and U.S., on the basis that such transfer mechanism does not comply with the level of protection required under the GDPR. There is also an increase in regulation of biometric data globally, which may include voiceprints. In addition, we are subject to laws relating specifically to personal health information, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996   HIPAA   and HITECH Act.  Changes in these data privacy and protection laws and regulations and inconsistencies in the standards that apply to our business in different jurisdictions may impose significant compliance costs, reduce the efficiency of our operations, expose us to enforcement risks, and materially adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and solutions. Any alleged or actual failure by us, our customers, suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could cause our customers to lose confidence in our solutions; harm our reputation; expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations and to resulting liabilities including reimbursement of customer costs, damages penalties or fines imposed by regulatory agencies, and require us to incur significant expenses for remediation.  We are also subject to a variety of anticorruption laws in respect of our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and regulations issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various other foreign governmental agencies. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing  laws might be administered or interpreted. Actual or alleged violations of these laws and regulations could lead to enforcement actions and financial penalties that could result in substantial costs.  Many of our customers are subject to various federal and state laws concerning their submission of claims for reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state government-sponsored health care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act  the False Claims Act , the federal anti-kickback statute, state false claims acts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal Stark Law and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or knowingly and improperly failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs and can be used as a vehicle to enforce each of these other laws. Claims under federal and state false claims acts can be brought by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a qui tam or whistleblower suit. If there is an adverse decision against us or our customers under these laws relating to use of our products or solutions, we may be required to pay damages, significant fines and or other monetary penalties, and our ability to market and sell such products or solutions to customers may be materially adversely impacted.  Interruptions or delays in our services, including from data center hosting facilities, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.  Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of third-party hardware and software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time, found defects in our services, and new errors in our services may be detected in the future. In addition, we currently serve our customers from data center hosting facilities we directly manage and from third party public cloud facilities. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems that serve our customers in whole or in part could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay service-level agreement penalties, cause customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.  We may be unable to fully capture the expected value from strategic transactions.  As part of our business strategy, we have in the past acquired and divested, and expect to continue to acquire and may divest, other businesses and technologies. We also expect to from time to time pursue other strategic transactions including divestitures, joint ventures, minority stakes and strategic alliances. Our acquisitions and divestitures have required substantial integration and management efforts, and we expect future acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to require similar efforts. Successfully realizing the benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions involves a number of risks, including   difficulty in transitioning and integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;  difficulty in separating the operations, personnel and systems of divested businesses   potential negative impact on our profitability as a result of losses that may result from a divestiture, including the loss of sales and operating income or decrease in cash flows;  retained exposure on financial guarantee leases, real estate and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations of divested business, and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer;  potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;  difficulty in incorporating acquired products and technologies into our products and technologies;  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development;  unanticipated expenses and delays in completing acquired development projects and technology integration and upgrades;  challenges associated with managing additional, geographically remote businesses;  impairment of relationships with partners and customers;  assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies;  the accuracy of revenue and bookings projections of acquired companies;  customers delaying purchases of our products pending resolution of product integration between our existing and our newly acquired products;  entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited experience; and  potential loss of key employees of the acquired business or loss of key employees of a divested business.  As a result of these and other risks, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. Any failure to achieve these benefits or failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or disaggregate divested businesses and technologies could seriously harm our business.  Charges to earnings as a result of our acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results in the foreseeable future, which could have a material and adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.  Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we record the market value of our common stock and other forms of consideration issued in connection with an acquisition as the cost of acquiring the company or business. We allocate that cost to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including various identifiable intangible assets such as acquired technology, acquired trade names and acquired customer relationships, based on their respective fair values. We base our estimates of fair value upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain. After we complete an acquisition, the following factors could result in material charges and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows   costs incurred to integrate the operations of businesses we acquire, such as transitional employee expenses and employee retention, redeployment or relocation expenses;  impairment of goodwill or intangible assets;  amortization of intangible assets acquired;  a reduction in the useful lives of intangible assets acquired;  identification of or changes to assumed contingent liabilities, both income tax and non-income tax related, after our final determination of the amounts for these contingencies or the conclusion of the measurement period  generally up to one year from the acquisition date , whichever comes first;  charges to our operating results to eliminate certain duplicative pre-merger activities, to restructure our operations or to reduce our cost structure;  charges to our operating results arising from expenses incurred to effect the acquisition; and  charges to our operating results due to the expensing of stock awards assumed in acquisitions.  Intangible assets are generally amortized over three to ten years. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is subject to an impairment analysis, at least annually, which may result in an impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. As of September 30, 2021, we recorded goodwill of  2,155.3 million and intangible assets of  128.3 million, net of accumulated amortization and impairment charges. In addition, purchase accounting limits our ability to recognize certain revenue that otherwise would have been recognized by the acquired company as an independent business. As a result, the combined company may delay revenue recognition or recognize less revenue than we and the acquired company would have recognized as independent companies.  Impairment of our intangible assets could result in significant charges that would adversely impact our future operating results.  We have significant intangible assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and core technologies, technologies and trademarks. Customer relationships are amortized on an accelerated basis based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of customer relationships are being utilized. Other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We assess the potential impairment of intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the following   significant adjustments to our multi-year operating plans, in connection with our ongoing portfolio review;  changes in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit;  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;  significant negative industry or economic trends;  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and  our market capitalization declining to below net book value.  Future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.  We have grown, and may continue to grow, through acquisitions, which could dilute our existing stockholders and or increase our debt levels.  In connection with past acquisitions, we have in the past issued a substantial number of shares of our common stock as transaction consideration, including contingent consideration, and also incurred significant debt to finance the cash consideration used for our acquisitions. We may continue to issue equity securities for future acquisitions, which would dilute existing stockholders, perhaps significantly, depending on the terms of such acquisitions. We may also incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions, which, if available at all, may place additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business.  Our strategy to transition to cloud-based recurring revenue may adversely affect our near-term revenue growth and results of operations.  We expect our ongoing shift from a software license model to cloud-based services revenue models to create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable. The transition, however, creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition. We also incur certain expenses associated with the infrastructures and selling efforts of our hosting offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings, which may adversely affect our near-term reported revenues, results of operations and cash flows. A decline in renewals of recurring revenue offerings in any period may not be immediately reflected in our results for that period but may result in a decline in our revenue and results of operations in future quarters.  We have a history of operating losses, and may incur losses in the future, which may require us to raise additional capital on unfavorable terms.  We had a total accumulated deficit of  298.9 million and  272.2 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. If we are unable to return to and sustain our profitability, the market price for our stock may decline, perhaps substantially. We cannot assure you that our revenue or bookings will grow or that we will sustain profitability in the future. If we do not achieve profitability, we may be required to raise additional capital to maintain or grow our operations. Additional capital, if available at all, may be highly dilutive to existing investors or contain other unfavorable terms, such as a high interest rate and restrictive covenants.  Tax matters may cause significant variability in our financial results.  Our businesses are subject to income taxation in the United States, as well as in many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. If our effective tax rate increases, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected. Our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments can vary significantly between periods due to a number of complex factors including   projected levels of taxable income;  pre-tax income being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates or higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory rates;  increases or decreases to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets;  tax audits conducted and settled by various tax authorities, either through administrative appeals, litigation or other dispute resolution methods;  adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of income tax returns;  the ability to claim foreign tax credits;  the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for income taxes; and  changes in tax laws and their interpretations in countries in which we are subject to taxation.  In December 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. We expect this to continue having a material impact on our tax financial results under United States generally accepted accounting principles. Future changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations could have a material effect on our results of operations in the periods in which such laws and regulations become effective as well as in future periods. In the United States, such law changes could include new tax revenue raising provisions tied to the proposed Build Back Better Act which is currently under consideration in Congress. Globally, the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit shifting is advancing fundamental changes to the international corporate tax system creating new rules for the allocation of rights to tax global income and a global minimum tax.  The failure to successfully maintain the adequacy of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to report our financial results in an accurate and timely manner.  Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we were required to develop and are required to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. In addition, our management is required to assess and certify the adequacy of our controls on a quarterly basis, and our independent auditors must attest and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. Any failure in the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to report our financial statements in an accurate and timely manner. Inaccurate and or untimely financial statements could subject us to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties, stockholder litigation, or loss of customer confidence, which could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace and ultimately could negatively impact our stock price due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.  Our sales to government clients subject us to risks, including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.  We derive a portion of our revenues and bookings from arrangements with governmental users in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere, contracts with the government in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere, as well as various state and local governments, and their respective agencies. Government contracts are generally subject to oversight, including audits and investigations which could identify violations of these agreements. Government contract violations could result in a range of consequences including, but not limited to, contract price adjustments, civil and criminal penalties, contract termination, forfeiture of profit and or suspension of payment, and suspension or debarment from future government contracts. We could also suffer serious harm to our reputation if we were found to have violated the terms of our government contracts.  Risks Related to the Merger  The announcement and pendency of the Merger may result in disruptions to our business.  On April 11, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Microsoft, pursuant to which we will be acquired by Microsoft in an all-cash transaction. The Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger and restricts us, without Microsofts consent, from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Further, in connection with the pending Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger, and may depart prior to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.  The proposed Merger further could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.  The pursuit of the Merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. It may also divert managements time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our remaining businesses and the execution of our other  strategic initiatives. This could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the pending Merger is consummated.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations and prospects.  The Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.  There can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe, or at all. The Merger Agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including, among others, the approval or clearance of the Merger under the antitrust and foreign investment laws of certain specified countries. There can be no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied  or waived, if applicable , and, if all required approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied  or waived, if applicable , we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied  or waived, as applicable . Even if regulatory approval is obtained, it is possible conditions will be imposed that could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on us.  If the Merger is not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In addition, some costs related to the Merger must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed, and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed transaction, as well as the diversion of management and resources towards the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if completion of the Merger does not occur. We may also experience negative reactions from our investors, customers, partners, suppliers, and employees. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of  515.0 million.  Stockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the pending Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.  We may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any future stockholder litigation in connection with the pending Merger. Such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the pending Merger. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such litigation, including costs associated with the indemnification of obligations to our directors.  Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology  Third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could be exposed to significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products if such claims are successful.  From time to time, we are subject to claims and legal actions alleging that we or our customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technologies and products. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants, the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us, and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation. Any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or licensing certain of our products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments to our customers. Any of these could seriously harm our business.  Unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our success and competitive position depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights protecting our products and services. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets,  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or discover aspects of our products or to obtain, license, sell or otherwise use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the same or superior to our technologies and that do not infringe our rights. In these cases, we would be unable to prevent our competitors from selling or licensing these similar or superior technologies. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Although the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, can be very expensive and can divert management efforts.  Our software products may have bugs, which could result in delayed or lost revenue and bookings, expensive correction, liability to our customers and claims against us.  Complex software products such as ours may contain errors, defects or bugs. Defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to our customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue and bookings, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services. Customers who are not satisfied with any of our products may also bring claims against us for damages, which, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm our reputation, financial results and competitive position.  Risks Related to our Indebtedness, Investments and Common Stock  Our debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.  Our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future debt agreements or arrangements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our ability to   incur additional debt or issue guarantees;  create liens;  make certain investments;  enter into transactions with our affiliates;  sell certain assets;  repurchase capital stock or make other restricted payments;  declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders; and  merge or consolidate with any entity.  Our ability to comply with these limitations is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. As a result of these limitations, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, our failure to comply with our debt covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay the accelerated debt.  Our significant debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our credit facility and our convertible debentures.  We have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30, 2021, we had  918.0 million outstanding principal of debt, including  500.0 million of senior notes due in 2026,  25.1 million of 1.5  2035 Convertible Debentures redeemable in November 2021,  130.3 million of 1.0  2035 Convertible Debentures redeemable in December 2022, and  262.6 million of 1.25  2025 Convertible Debentures redeemable in April 2025. Investors may require us to redeem these convertible debentures earlier than the dates indicated if the closing sale price of our common stock is more than 130  of the then current conversion price of the respective debentures for certain specified periods. If a holder elects to convert, we will be required to pay the principal amount in cash and any amounts payable in excess of the principal amount in cash or shares of our common stock, at  our election. For example, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, holders of  118.3 million of our 1.5  2035 Convertible Debentures exercised their rights to require us to repurchase such debentures. We also have a  300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility under which  1.9 million was committed to backing outstanding letters of credit issued and  298.1 million was available for borrowing at September 30, 2021. Our debt level could have important consequences. For example, it could   require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, including the convertible debentures and the credit facility, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, exploit business opportunities, and undertake other business activities;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and  limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants related to our debt, our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends.  Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the convertible debentures and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the convertible debentures, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the convertible debentures and our other debt.  Current uncertainty in the global financial markets and the global economy may negatively affect the value of our investment portfolio.  Our investment portfolios, which include investments in money market funds, bank deposits and separately managed investment portfolios, are generally subject to credit, liquidity, counterparty, market and interest rate risks that may be exacerbated by a global financial crisis or by uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union or recent changes in tariffs and trade agreements. If the banking system or the fixed income, credit or equity markets deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted, and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected.  The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations, and this may make it difficult for our stockholders to resell the common stock when they want or at prices they find attractive.  Our stock price historically has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Various factors contribute to the volatility of our stock price, including, for example, the status of the potential Merger, quarterly variations in our financial results, new product introductions by us or our competitors and general economic and market conditions. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our largest stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, could also contribute to the volatility or our stock price. While we cannot predict the individual effect that any of these factors may have on the market price of our common stock, these factors, either individually or in the aggregate, could result in significant volatility in our stock price. Moreover, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock may be subject to securities class action litigation. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.  Future issuances of our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.  Future issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock, whether in the public market or through private placements, including issuances in connection with acquisition activities, or the perception that such issuances could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. In connection with past acquisitions, we issued a substantial number of shares of our common stock as transaction consideration or contingent consideration. We may continue to issue equity securities for future acquisitions, which would dilute existing stockholders, perhaps significantly depending on the terms of such acquisitions. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, will have on the trading price of our common stock.  Our business could be negatively affected by the actions of activist stockholders.  In the past, certain stockholders have publicly and privately expressed concerns with our performance and with certain governance matters. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Furthermore, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. In addition, we have enacted certain changes to our bylaws in the past year that may weaken our ability to prevent an unsolicited takeover."}

On March 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the Business and received proceeds of approximately  29.8 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. For all periods presented, the Businesses' results of operations have been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.  Acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation  On April 11, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Microsoft. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance for  56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the Merger, Nuance will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of  515.0 million. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022.  For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the definitive proxy statement previously filed with the SEC and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about Nuance and the Merger.

The decrease in cost of revenues amortization expense was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in fiscal year 2021, and the increase in operating amortization expense was primarily due to acquired technology assets from a recent acquisition.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Amortization of intangible assets expense for fiscal year 2020 decreased by  0.1 million.  Acquisition-Related Costs, Net  Acquisition-related costs, net include costs related to business and asset acquisitions.

Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Acquisition-related costs, net decreased by  3.6 million, primarily due to overall reduced acquisition and integration activities as we focused on portfolio optimization and organizational simplification to drive organic growth.

These actions were part of our strategic initiatives focused on investment rationalization, process optimization and cost reduction as we continue to evaluate the geographic footprint of our offices and facilities. We expect the remaining outstanding severance of  0.4 million to be substantially paid during fiscal year 2022, and the remaining  16.9 million lease payments to be made through fiscal year 2027, in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases.  Additionally, during fiscal year 2021, we recorded approximately  21.0 million of expenses related to the acquisition of Nuance by Microsoft, and  1.4 million of professional service expenses related to other corporate initiatives, offset in part by  3.1 million of insurance recoveries.  Fiscal Year 2020  For fiscal year 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of  10.7 million, which included  5.1 million related to the termination of approximately 191 employees and  5.5 million of charges related to closing certain idle facilities.

Fiscal Year 2019  For fiscal year 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of  17.4 million, which included  15.2 million related to the termination of approximately 305 employees and  2.2 million in charges related to the closing of certain idle facilities. These actions were part of our strategic initiatives focused on investment rationalization, process optimization and cost reduction.  Additionally, during fiscal year 2019, we recorded  9.9 million of professional services fees related to our corporate transformational efforts and  3.3 million accelerated depreciation related to our Mobile Operator Services, offset in part by  0.5 million of insurance recoveries.  Other Income  Expense , Net  Other expenses, net consists primarily of interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange gains  losses , and net gains  losses  from other non-operating activities.

The decrease in interest expense was due to redemptions of  521.9 million notional amounts of the 1.0  and 1.5  Convertible Debentures during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, holders of our 1.0  and 1.5  Convertible Debentures exercised their right to convert  226.6 million notional amount during fiscal year 2021.  The increase of other expense, net was primarily due to losses on conversions and redemptions of debt in fiscal year 2021.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower yields and the decreases in cash and marketable securities for the current year period.  The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the repayments of  300.0 million of the 2020 Senior Notes in March 2019 and  300.0 million of the 2024 Senior Notes in October 2019, as well as the repurchases of  123.8 million notional amounts of the 1.25  and 1.5  Convertible Debentures during the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.  The increase of other expense, net was primarily due to losses on redemption and repurchases of debt in fiscal year 2020, offset  in part by higher gains on foreign currency transactions.  Provision  Benefit  for Income Taxes  The following table shows the provision  benefit  for income taxes on continuing operations and the effective income tax rate  dollars in millions    Fiscal Year 2021 Fiscal Year 2020 Fiscal Year 2019   Change 2021 vs. 2020   Change 2020 vs. 2019  Provision  benefit  for income taxes    5.4    30.9     23.2   117.5    33.1    Effective income tax rate  45.2    70.3   35.8    The effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the geographic mix of our income, the composition of the income in different countries, changes relating to valuation allowances and the potential tax consequences of resolving audits or other tax contingencies.  Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020  The effective income tax rate in fiscal year 2021 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0  primarily due to a change in the valuation allowance in the United States as well as the addition of uncertain tax positions partially offset by base erosion and anti-abuse planning initiatives.  Provision for income taxes increased by  36.3 million in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to a net  29.9 million deferred tax benefit from adjustments to domestic valuation allowance primarily related to the Cerence spin-off and a foreign tax benefit of  14.8 million related to fiscal year 2019 intangible property transfers offset by base erosion and anti-abuse planning initiatives.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  The effective income tax rate in fiscal year 2020 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0  primarily due to a net  29.9 million deferred tax benefit from adjustments to domestic valuation allowance primarily related to the Cerence spin-off, a foreign tax benefit of  14.8 million related to prior year intangible property transfers, offset in part by uncertain tax positions of  17.1 million and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax of  4.3 million.  Benefit for income taxes increased by  7.7 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to a  29.9 million net deferred tax benefit from adjustments to the domestic valuation allowance primarily related to the Cerence spin-off.  Valuation Allowances  As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, we had a full valuation allowance against net domestic deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the release of all or some portion of these allowances. A significant portion of our domestic deferred tax assets relate to U.S. net operating losses. We continue to believe negative evidence for the release of some or all of the allowances outweighs positive evidence after considering recent profitability trends and the disposition of the medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses. We continue to evaluate all sources of domestic taxable income including both the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood that we could sustain pretax profitability in the future. As of September 30, 2021, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next twelve months these sources of taxable income may become sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that a substantial portion of the domestic valuation allowance, excluding capital losses, could be released.  Net  Loss  Income from Discontinued Operations  Disposition of Our Medical Transcription and EHR Implementation businesses  On November 17, 2020, we entered into the Agreement to sell the Business to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group  together, the Buyer . Pursuant to the Agreement, we sold and transferred, and the Buyer purchased and acquired,  a  the shares of certain subsidiaries through which we operate a portion of the Business and  b  certain assets used in or related to the Business; and the Buyer assumed certain liabilities related to such assets of the Business, subject to certain exclusions and indemnities as set forth in the Agreement.  On March 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the Business and received approximately  29.8 million in cash, subject to post-closing finalization of the adjustments set forth in the Agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss of  12.5 million, which is included within net  loss  income from discontinued operations. There are a number of working capital and other adjustments under the Agreement and related ancillary agreements. We do not believe that post-closing working capital adjustments under the Agreement, if any, will have a material impact on our results of operations.  For all periods presented, the Businesses' results of operations have been included within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

Segment Revenues  Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020  Healthcare segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 increased by  85.9 million, or 11.9 , driven primarily by growth in the Dragon Medical and CAPD cloud offerings. Revenue from Dragon Medical cloud and DAX cloud-based solutions increased by  78.3 million, or 28.0 , to  358.4 million for fiscal year 2021 from  280.1 million for fiscal year 2020, primarily due to the continued market penetration and customer transition to DMO.  Enterprise segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 increased by  5.4 million, or 1.0 , primarily due to the growth in our Security and Biometrics solutions.  Other segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 decreased by  13.0 million, or 38.3 , as we continue to wind down our Other segment.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Healthcare segment revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased by  19.7 million, or 2.8 , primarily due to the growth in Dragon Medical and DAX cloud-based solutions.  Enterprise segment revenue for fiscal year 2020 increased by  19.2 million, or 3.8 , primarily due to the growth in digital engagement solutions.  Other segment revenue for fiscal year 2020 decreased by  27.6 million, or 44.9 , due to the wind-down of Devices and the sale of our Mobile Operator Services business in fiscal year 2019.  Segment Profit  Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020  Healthcare segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased by  35.4 million, or 15.4 , primarily driven by revenue growth in the Dragon Medical, CAPD, and CDI cloud offerings. Segment profit margin increased by 1.0 percentage points to 32.9 , primarily driven by growth in our Dragon Medical cloud-based solution, which is margin accretive.  Enterprise segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 decreased by  7.1 million, or 4.9 , as higher segment revenue was more than offset by higher operating expenses. Segment profit margin decreased by 1.6 percentage points to 25.7 , primarily due to higher operating expenses, which was only partially offset by higher segment revenues.  Other segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2021 decreased by  8.4 million, or 42.5 , as we continue to wind down our Other segment. Segment profit margin decreased by 4.0 percentage points to 54.1 .  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Healthcare segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 decreased by  22.9 million, or 9.1 , primarily due to higher R D and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by higher revenue and gross margin improvement. Gross margin increased primarily due to a favorable shift in mix to higher margin Dragon Medical cloud-based solution. The increases in R D and sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to higher spend to support the development and launch of new products and solutions. As a result, segment profit margin decreased by 4.2 percentage points to 31.9 .  Enterprise segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased by  17.6 million, or 13.8 , primarily due to higher segment revenue and gross margin, offset in part by higher R D and sales expenses. Gross margin improvement was primarily driven by a favorable shift in revenue mix towards higher-margin license revenue. The increase in R D expense was primarily due to higher spend on core technologies to support future growth. The increase in sales expense was primarily driven by higher commission costs due to higher bookings, offset in part by lower travel and entertainment expenses during the pandemic. As a result, segment profit margin increased by 2.4 percentage points to 27.3 .  Other segment profit for the year ended September 30, 2020 increased by  0.3 million, or 1.5 , primarily driven by lower expense profile of the remaining business, offset in part by lower revenue. As a result, segment profit margin increased by 26.5 percentage points to 58.1   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Liquidity  We had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  209.5 million as of September 30, 2021, a decrease of  162.9 million from  372.3 million as of September 30, 2020. Our working capital, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities of continuing operations, was   324.8  million as of September 30, 2021, compared to   256.5  million as of September 30, 2020. Our working capital included  373.0 million and  432.2 million convertible debt as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, we had  298.1 million available for borrowing under our revolving  credit facility. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity are sufficient to support our operating needs, capital requirements and any debt service requirements for the next twelve months.  Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our international operations totaled  35.7 million as of September 30, 2021 and  60.9 million as of September 30, 2020. We utilize a variety of financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available to meet our liquidity needs. We expect the cash held overseas to be permanently invested in our international operations, and our U.S. operation to be funded through its own operating cash flows, cash and marketable securities within the U.S., and if necessary, borrowing under our revolving credit facility.  Acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation  On April 11, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Microsoft. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance for  56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the Merger Nuance will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. The consummation of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, but it is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022.  For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the definitive proxy statement previously filed with the SEC and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about Nuance and the Merger.  Disposition of Our Medical Transcription and EHR Implementation Businesses  In connection with our ongoing comprehensive portfolio and business review, on November 17, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses.  On March 1, 2021, we completed the sale of the Business and received approximately  29.8 million in cash, subject to post- losing finalization of the adjustments set forth in the Agreement. As a result, we recorded a loss of  12.5 million, which is included within Net  loss  income from discontinued operations. There are a number of working capital and other adjustments under the Agreement and related ancillary agreements. We do not believe that post-closing working capital adjustments under the Agreement, if any, will have a material impact on our results of operations.  Convertible Debentures  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our common stock price exceeded the conversion threshold price of 130  of the applicable conversion price per share for each of our convertible debentures for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending September 30, 2021. As a result, the holders of our 1.25  2025 Debentures and 1.0  2035 Debentures have the right to convert all or any portion of their debentures between October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Additionally, on November 5, 2021, we redeemed all of the outstanding 1.5  2035 Debentures. All three convertible notes, with a total net book value of  373.0 million, were included within current liabilities as of September 30, 2021.  Should any holders elect to convert, the principal amount of the convertible debentures would be payable in cash, and any amount payable in excess of the principal amount would be paid in cash or shares of our common stock at our election. During fiscal year 2021, holders of our 1.5  2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert  137.4 million notional amount for  137.4 million in cash and 4.1 million shares of common stock, and holders of our 1.0  2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert  89.2 million notional amount for  89.2 million in cash and 2.1 million shares of common stock. Additionally, during fiscal year 2021, we induced the exchange of  457.0 million notional amount of our 1.0  2035 Debentures for  5.0 million in cash and 18.9 million shares of common stock, and  64.9 million notional amount of our 1.5  2035 Debentures for  0.5 million in cash and 3.2 million shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2021,  130.3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.0  2035 Debentures and  25.1 million in aggregate principal amount of the 1.5  2035 Debentures remained outstanding.  Our convertible debentures are actively traded in the open market. The 1.25  2025 Debentures trade at a price consistently in excess of their conversion values. Therefore, we believe that it is uneconomic, and thus unlikely, for the holders of the 1.25  2025 Debentures to early exercise their conversion rights. In the event that holders of any of our debentures presented an amount for settlement that exceeded our then available sources of liquidity, we may need to obtain additional financing, which we believe would be available to us based upon our assessment of the prevailing market and business conditions and our experience of successful capital raising activities.  Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020  Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was  247.6 million, a decrease of  6.9 million from  254.6 million cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to   A decrease of  53.5 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations; and  A decrease of  30.6 million from changes in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue had a negative effect of  9.3 million on operating cash flows for fiscal year 2021, as compared to a positive effect of  21.3 million for fiscal year 2020; offset in part by,  An increase of  33.3 million due to favorable changes in working capital, primarily related to the timing of cash collections and cash payments;  An increase of  43.8 million due to lower non-cash charges, primarily related to the timing of deferred tax benefits.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2020 was  254.6 million, a decrease of  146.8 million from  401.4 million cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2019. The net decrease was primarily due to   A decrease of  95.1 million due to unfavorable changes in working capital, primarily related to the timing of cash collections and cash payments; and  A decrease of  116.5 million in operating cash flows from discontinued operations; offset in part by,  An increase of  42.4 million due to higher income before non-cash charges; and  An increase of  22.3 million from changes in deferred revenue. Deferred revenue had a positive effect of  21.3 million on operating cash flows for fiscal year 2020, as compared to  1.1 million for fiscal year 2019.  Net Cash  Used in  Provided by Investing Activities  Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020  Cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 was  42.4 million, a decrease of  115.2 million from  72.7 million cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to   A decrease of  84.8 million in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities and other investments; and  A decrease of  0.4 million in cash provided by other investing activities; and  An increase of  44.4 million in payments for business and asset acquisitions; offset in part by,  An increase of  9.7 million in net proceeds from the disposition of businesses, primarily from the sale of our medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses; and  A decrease of  4.8 million in cash used for capital expenditures.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year 2020 was  72.7 million, a decrease of  223.3 million from  296.0 million cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2019. The net decrease was primarily due to   Net proceeds of  406.9 million, primarily from the sale of our Imaging business during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019; and  An increase of  17.1 million in cash used for capital expenditures; offset in part by,  An increase of  179.7 million in net proceeds from the sale and purchase of marketable securities and other investments; and  A decrease of  19.9 million in payments for business and asset acquisitions.  Net Cash Used in Financing Activities  Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020  Cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2021 was  322.7 million, a decrease of  263.5 million from  586.2 million cash used in fiscal year 2020. The net decrease was primarily due to   A decrease of  283.6 million in cash used for the repayment and redemption of debt; and  A decrease of  169.2 million in share repurchases; offset in part by,  An increase of  48.1 million related to payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards; and  An increase of  2.1 million cash used for other financing activities; and  A net contribution of  139.1 million from Cerence in connection with the spin-off of our Automobile business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Fiscal Year 2020 compared to Fiscal Year 2019  Cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2020 was  586.2 million, an increase of  134.2 million from  452.0 million cash used in fiscal year 2019. The net increase was primarily due to   An increase of  213.6 million in the repayment and redemption of debt;  Net proceeds of  9.9 million from sale of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary in fiscal year 2019;  An increase of  42.3 million in share repurchases;  An increase of  4.6 million related to payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards; offset in part by,  A net contribution of  139.1 million from Cerence in connection with the spin-off of our Automobile business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Debt  For a detailed description of the terms and restrictions of the debt and revolving credit facility, see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we spent approximately  232.1 million in cash and issued 28.2 million shares of common stock for the redemption of debt   In May 2021, holders of our 1.5  2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert  118.3 million notional amount for  118.3 million in cash and 3.5 million shares of common stock.  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we induced the exchange of  457.0 million notional amount of our 1.0  2035 Debentures for  5.0 million in cash and 18.9 million shares of common stock, and  64.9 million notional amount of 1.5  2035 Debentures for  0.5 million in cash and 3.2 million shares of common stock.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, holders of our 1.5  2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert  19.0 million notional amount for  19.0 million in cash and 0.6 million shares of common stock, and holders of our 1.0  2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert  89.2 million notional amount for  89.2 million in cash and 2.1 million shares of common stock.  Additionally, certain debt holders have exercised their right to convert Debentures that did not settle on or prior to September 30, 2021. Holders of our 1.0  2035 Debentures exercised their right to convert  2.3 million notional amount for  2.3 million in cash and 0.1 million shares of common stock. Additionally, holders of our 1.25  2025 Debentures exercised  their right to convert  1.2 million notional amount for  1.2 million in cash and 0.04 million shares of common stock. The settlements of these conversions occurred subsequent to September 30, 2021, but before the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  On September 29, 2021, we issued a notice calling for redemption all of our outstanding 1.5  2035 Debentures, pursuant to which, the holders had the right to receive cash at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the 1.5  2035 Debentures plus any accrued and unpaid interest, including any additional interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date of November 5th, 2021. In lieu of redemption, holders had the right to convert all or any portion of their debentures at the aforementioned conversion ratio until the close of business on November 4, 2021. Upon the conclusion of the conversion period on November 4, 2021, holders of  25.0 million notional amount exercised their right to convert. Additionally, we redeemed the remaining outstanding  0.1 million 1.5  2035 Debentures for  0.1 million in cash. On November 5, 2021, we settled all of the outstanding 1.5  2035 Debentures for  25.1 million in cash and 0.8 million shares of common stock. Following these redemptions and conversions, none of the 1.5  2035 Debentures remain outstanding.  As of September 30, 2021, we were in compliance with all the debt covenants. We may from time to time, depending on market and business conditions, repurchase outstanding debt in the open market or by private negotiation. We expect to incur cash interest payments of  32.9 million during fiscal year 2022. We expect to fund our debt service requirements through existing sources of liquidity and our operating cash flows.  Share Repurchases  On April 29, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to  500.0 million, which was increased by  500.0 million on April 29, 2015. On August 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an additional  500.0 million under our share repurchase program. Under the terms of the share repurchase program, we have the ability to repurchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or any combination of such methods. The share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by us at any time without prior notice. The timing and the amount of any purchases are subject to our assessment of the prevailing market conditions, general economic conditions, capital allocation alternatives, and other factors.  We did not repurchase any shares during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and repurchased 9.5 million shares and 8.2 million shares for  169.2 million and  126.9 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the program. The amount paid in excess of par value is recognized in additional paid in capital and these shares were retired upon repurchase. Since the commencement of the program, we have repurchased 73.8 million shares for  1,238.8 million. The amount paid in excess of par value is recognized in additional paid in capital. Shares were retired upon repurchase. As of September 30, 2021, approximately  261.2 million remained available for future repurchases under the program.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commitments  Contractual Obligations  The following table outlines our contractual payment obligations for continuing operations as of September 30, 2021  dollars in millions    Contractual payments Due in Fiscal Year  Contractual Obligations Total 2022 2023 and 2024 2025 and 2026 Thereafter  Convertible debentures  1     418.0   418.0   -   -   -  Senior notes  2   500.0 - - 500.0 -  Interest payable on long-term debt  3   168.0 32.9 63.1 57.9 14.1  Letters of credit  4   1.9 1.9 - - -  Lease obligations and other liabilities   Operating leases  5   107.6 22.4 31.0 24.1 30.1  Operating leases under restructuring 14.5 5.3 6.0 2.7 0.5  Purchase commitments for inventory, property and equipment  6   74.0 59.5 14.5 - -  Total contractual cash obligations   1,284.0   540.0   114.6   584.7   44.7                    1  As of September 30, 2021, the holders have the right to convert all or any portion of the 1.25  2025 Debentures, 1.5  2035 Debentures, and 1.0  2035 Debentures between October 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. As a result, these convertible debentures were treated as if they were due in fiscal year 2022.   2 The repayment schedule reflects the outstanding principal amount of our 5.625  senior notes due 2026 as of September 30, 2021.   3 Interest per annum is due and payable semi-annually and is determined based on the outstanding principal as of September 30, 2021, the stated interest rate of each debt instrument and the assumed redemption dates discussed above.   4 Letters of credit are in place primarily to secure future operating lease payments.   5 Obligations include contractual lease commitments related to facilities that have subsequently been subleased. As of September 30, 2021, we have subleased certain facilities with total sublease income of  10.8 million through fiscal year 2027.   6 These amounts include non-cancelable purchase commitments for property and equipment as well as inventory in the normal course of business to fulfill customer backlog. We entered into an agreement with Microsoft in October of 2019 for their Azure cloud computing service with a minimum commitment of  175.0 million. This contract is expected to be in effect through fiscal year 2024.  As of September 30, 2021,  60.1 million of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes of  1.7 million,  1.1 million, and  0.4 million during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We recorded interest and penalties of  3.5 million and  1.7 million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Contingent Liabilities and Commitments  Certain acquisition payments to selling stockholders were contingent upon the achievement of predetermined performance targets over a period of time after the acquisition. Such contingent payments were recorded at estimated fair values upon the acquisition and re-measured in subsequent reporting periods. As of September 30, 2021, we do not have any requirements to pay any selling stockholders based upon the achievement of any specified performance goals. In addition, certain deferred compensation payments to selling stockholders contingent upon their continued employment after the acquisition were recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period. Additionally, as of September 30, 2021, the remaining deferred payment obligations of  15.0 million to certain former stockholders, which are contingent upon their continued employment, will be recognized ratably as compensation expense over the remaining requisite service periods.  Microsoft Acquisition Contingent Consideration  On April 11, 2021, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Microsoft, subject to the terms of which Microsoft has agreed to acquire Nuance. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions including satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals. The Merger is currently expected to close by the end of our first quarter or early in our second quarter of fiscal year 2022. As part of the transaction, Nuance expects to incur liabilities of approximately  114.0 million that are contingent on the deal consummation. These liabilities include banker fees, legal fees, and certain retention bonuses.  Financial Instruments  We use financial instruments to manage our foreign exchange risk. We operate our business in countries throughout the world and transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operations. We have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effect of certain foreign currency exposures. Our program is designed so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. Generally, we enter into such contracts for less than 90 days and have no cash requirements until maturity. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding contracts with a total notional value of  52.5 million and  40.7 million, respectively.  Defined Benefit Plans  We sponsor certain defined benefit plans that are offered primarily by our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our defined benefit pension income was  0.2 million,  0.4 million, and  0.5 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 was  34.9 million and  35.4 million, respectively. The aggregate net liability of our defined benefit plans as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 was  10.1 million and  13.2 million, respectively.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Through September 30, 2021, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS, AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition; allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns; accounting for deferred costs; accounting for internally developed software; the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for business combinations, including contingent consideration; accounting for stock-based compensation; accounting for derivative instruments; accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances; and loss contingencies. Our management bases its estimates on historical experience, market participant fair value considerations, projected future cash flows and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  We believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult and subjective judgments.  Revenue Recognition  We derive revenue from the following sources   1  hosting services,  2  software licenses, including royalties,  3  maintenance and support   M S  ,  4  professional services, and  5  sale of hardware. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax, value-added tax and other transaction taxes imposed on the related transaction including mandatory government charges that are passed through to our customers. We account for a contract when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and the collectibility of the consideration is probable.  The majority of our arrangements with customers typically contain multiple products and services. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct, that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.  We recognize revenue after applying the following five steps   identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;  identification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract;  determination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;  allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and  recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.  We allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated standalone selling price   SSP   of each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs and consider a number of data points, including   the pricing of standalone sales  in the instances where available ;  the pricing established by management when setting prices for deliverables that are intended to be sold on a standalone basis;  contractually stated prices for deliverables that are intended to be sold on a standalone basis; and  other pricing factors, such as the geographical region in which the products are sold, and expected discounts based on the customer size and type.  We only include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We reduce transaction prices for estimated returns and other allowances that represent variable consideration under ASC 606, which we estimate based on historical return experience and other relevant factors, and record a reduction to revenue and accounts receivable. Other forms of contingent revenue or variable consideration are infrequent.  Revenue is recognized when control of these products and services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.  We assess the timing of the transfer of products or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set-up fees nor other upfront fees paid by our customers to represent a financing component.  Certain products are sold through distributors or resellers. Certain distributors and resellers have been granted right of return and selling incentives which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to be recognized. Returns and credits are estimated at the contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-10-4, we apply a portfolio approach to estimate the variable consideration associated with this group of customers.  Reimbursements for out-of-pocket costs generally include, but are not limited to, costs related to transportation, lodging and meals. Revenue from reimbursed out-of-pocket costs is accounted for as variable consideration.  Shipping and handling activities are not considered a contract performance obligation. We record shipping and handling costs billed to customers as revenue with offsetting costs recorded as cost of revenue.  Performance Obligations  Hosting  Hosting services, which allow our customers to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a usage basis as consumed or on a fixed fee subscription basis. Our hosting contract terms generally range from one to five years.  As each day of providing services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, we have determined that our hosting services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services. These services include variable consideration, which is typically a function of usage. We recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed  i.e., recognized as incurred .  Subscription basis revenue represents a single promise to stand-ready to provide access to our hosting services. Revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the hosting contract term, which generally ranges from one to five years.  Software Licenses  On-premise software licenses sold with non-distinct professional services to customize and or integrate the underlying software are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue from the combined performance obligation is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.  Revenue from distinct on-premise software licenses, which do not require professional services to customize and or integrate the software license, is recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer and control is transferred.  Revenue from software licenses sold on a royalty basis, where the license of intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates, is recognized in the period the usage occurs in accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-65 A .  Maintenance and Support  Our M S contracts generally include telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and updates on a when-and-if available basis. M S revenue is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period because we transfer control evenly by providing a stand-ready service.  Professional Services  Revenue from distinct professional services, including training, is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.  Hardware  Hardware revenue is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon delivery.  Significant Judgments  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Our license contracts often include professional services to customize and or integrate the licenses into the customers environment. Judgment is required to determine whether the license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with professional services.  Judgments are required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. When SSP is directly observable, we estimate SSP based upon the historical transaction prices, adjusted for geographic considerations, customer classes, and customer relationship profiles. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We may have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining SSP. Determining SSP for performance obligations which we never sell separately also requires significant judgment. In estimating the SSP, we consider the likely price that would have resulted from established pricing practices had the deliverable been offered separately and the prices a customer would likely be willing to pay.  From time to time, we may enter into arrangements with third party suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, we evaluate whether we are the principal  i.e. report revenues on a gross basis  or agent  i.e. report revenues on a net basis . In doing so, we first evaluate whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. If we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer, we are the principal; if not, we are the agent. Generally, we control a promised good or service before transferring that good or service to the customer and act as the principal to the transaction. Determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer may require judgment.  Goodwill Impairment Analysis  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but rather the carrying amounts of these assets are assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In fiscal year 2017, we elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment for its annual goodwill impairment test. ASU 2017-04 removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test requiring a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. There was no goodwill impairment for fiscal year 2021 and 2020.  For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated into one reporting unit for the purpose of  goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure.  Corporate assets and liabilities are allocated to each reporting unit based on the reporting units revenue, total operating expenses or operating income as a percentage of the consolidated amounts. Corporate debt and other financial liabilities that are not directly attributable to the reporting unit's operations and would not be transferred to hypothetical purchasers of the reporting units are excluded from a reporting unit's carrying amount.  We evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative analysis and determined goodwill was not impaired. As part of that analysis we assessed goodwill using an entity valuation, which was derived based on the attribution of the agreed-upon purchase price for the announced Microsoft acquisition of Nuance. We use key financial metrics to allocate the purchase price to each reporting unit.  Intangible Assets and long-lived Asset groups  Long-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the asset group is also a reporting unit, goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is also included in the carrying amount of the asset group. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset groups carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group.  Income Taxes  Deferred Taxes  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. As the income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements, the amounts recorded for the current period reflect estimates for the tax-based activity for the period. In addition, estimates are often required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state and foreign income tax rates to use, the potential utilization of operating loss carry-forwards and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions.  Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.  We have historically estimated the future tax consequence of certain items, including bad debts, inventory valuation, and accruals that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are paid or the related assets are disposed. We believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law. The income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, we do not accrue tax for the repatriation of such foreign earnings.  Valuation Allowance  We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need  for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses. Generally, cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed.  As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, we had a full valuation allowance against net domestic deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the release of all or some portion of these allowances. A significant portion of our domestic deferred tax assets relate to U.S. net operating losses. We continue to believe negative evidence regarding the deferred tax assets outweighs positive evidence after considering recent profitability trends and the disposition of the medical transcription and EHR implementation businesses. We continue to evaluate all sources of domestic taxable income including both the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood that we could sustain pretax profitability in the future. As of September 30, 2021, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that within the next twelve months these sources of taxable income may become sufficient positive evidence to support a conclusion that a substantial portion of the domestic valuation allowance, excluding capital losses, could be released.  Uncertain Tax Positions  We operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly-owned subsidiaries and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions involve judgments and assessment of the potential tax implications related to legal entity restructuring, credits, intercompany transfer and acquisition or divestiture. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  Our tax positions are subject to audit by taxing authorities across multiple global jurisdictions and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may owe may differ from the amounts recognized.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting standards.  ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain issued accounting standards that have not been adopted and may impact our financial statements in future reporting periods."}

The acquisition of AGI enables our customers to consider the entire mission engineering of a product or system. Engineered products and systems can involve thousands of components, subsystems, systems, and systems of systems that must work together intricately. Our software simulates all these pieces of the puzzle and their functional relationships to each other, and increasingly to their environments.  PRODUCT QUALITY  Our employees generally perform product development tasks according to predefined quality plans, procedures and work instructions. Certain technical support tasks are also subject to a quality process. These plans define, for each project, the methods to be used, the responsibilities of project participants and the quality objectives to be met. The majority of our software products are developed under a quality system that is certified to the ISO 9001 2015 standard. We establish quality plans for our products and services, and subject product designs to multiple levels of testing and verification in accordance with processes established under our quality system.  SALES AND MARKETING  We distribute and support our products through our own direct sales offices, as well as a global network of independent channel partners. This channel partner network provides us with a cost-effective, highly-specialized channel of distribution and technical support. It also enables us to draw on business and technical expertise from a global network, provides relative stability to our operations to help mitigate geography-specific economic trends and provides us with an opportunity to take advantage of new geographic markets or enhance our sales coverage in existing markets.  The channel partners market and sell our products to new customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer training and consulting services, and provide the first line of our technical support. Our channel partner certification process helps to ensure that each channel partner has the ongoing capability to adequately represent our expanding product lines and to provide an acceptable level of training, consultation and customer support. We derived 22.2 , 22.9  and 22.4  of our total revenue through the indirect sales channel for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  We also have a direct sales organization to develop an enterprise-wide, focused sales approach and to implement a worldwide go-to-market account strategy. The sales management organization also functions as a focal point for requests from the channel partners and provides additional support in strategic locations through the presence of direct sales offices.  During 2020, we continued to invest in our existing domestic and international strategic sales offices. In total, our direct sales and marketing organization comprised 2,400 and 2,100 employees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, who were responsible for the sales, technical support, consulting services, marketing initiatives, and administrative activities designed to support our overall revenue growth and expansion strategies.  Our products are utilized by organizations ranging in size from small consulting firms to the world's largest high-tech and industrial companies. No single customer accounted for more than 5  of our revenue in 2020, 2019 or 2018.  Information with respect to foreign and domestic revenue may be found in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the section entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND MARKETING RELATIONSHIPS  We have established and continued to pursue strategic alliances with advanced technology suppliers, cloud computing providers, hardware vendors, software vendors, specialized application developers, and CAD, ECAD and PLM providers. We believe that these relationships facilitate accelerated incorporation of advanced technology into our products, provide access to new customers, expand our sales channels, develop specialized product applications, and provide direct integration with leading CAD, electronic design automation  EDA , product data management and PLM systems.  We have technical and marketing relationships with leading CAD vendors, such as Autodesk, PTC and Siemens Digital Industries, to provide direct links between products. These links facilitate the transfer of electronic data models between the CAD systems and our products.  We partner with PTC to accelerate product innovation by providing customers a world-class simulation-driven design solution. Working together, we are delivering Ansys Live real-time simulation technology within PTCs Creo 3D CAD software. The combined solution, Creo Simulation Live, is sold by PTC as part of the Creo product suite. This solution offers customers a unified modeling and simulation environment, removing the boundaries between CAD and simulation and enabling design engineers to gain insight into each of the many design decisions they make throughout the product development process. This insight enables design engineers to create higher quality products, while reducing product and development costs. In November 2020, PTC released Creo Ansys Simulation, which includes a subset of our flagship solver technology integrated into Creo.  We maintain marketing and software development relationships with leading EDA software companies, including Cadence Design Systems, Synopsys, Siemens EDA, and Zuken. These relationships support the transfer of data between electronics design and layout software and our electronics simulation portfolio. We have an integration and distribution agreement with Synopsys to cooperatively integrate Ansys RedHawk technology into an in-design add-on to a Synopsys design tool for the primary purpose of providing customers with direct, in-design access to the RedHawk technology's capabilities. In addition, we continue to focus on customer solutions and are actively working together to build additional products and interoperability workflows.  We have a strategic relationship with Microsoft that spans several Ansys business units and markets. The primary focus of the relationship centers on Ansys Cloud, which is a cloud-based simulation service fully managed by Ansys and hosted on Microsofts Azure Cloud infrastructure. Ansys Cloud provides on-demand access to HPC directly from within our flagship applications. We continue to expand the licensing options and functionality of Ansys Cloud, often working closely with Microsoft for support and technical advice.

With more than 200 active solution partnerships, spanning a wide range of technologies, including materials, optimization, electronics, optical, mechanical, fluid and systems simulation, our partner ecosystem extends the depth and breadth of our technology offerings. We also work to democratize HPC to a wider audience through partnerships with cloud computing providers, cloud-hosting partners, HPC hardware manufacturers and supercomputing centers.  COMPETITION  We believe that the principal factors affecting sales of our software include ease of use, breadth and depth of functionality, flexibility, quality, ease of integration with other software systems, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, performance, price and total cost of ownership, customer service and support, company reputation and financial viability, and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.  We continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services. Our competitors include large, global, publicly traded companies; small, geographically-focused firms; startup firms; and solutions produced in-house by the end users. Some of our current and possible future competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than us, and some have well-established relationships with current and potential customers of ours. Our current and possible future competitors also include firms that have elected, or may in the future elect, to compete by means of open source licensing. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES  We regard our software as proprietary and rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that predominantly grant customers nonexclusive licenses, which are typically nontransferable, for the use of our products. License agreements for our products are generally directly between us and end users. Use of the licensed software product is restricted to specified sites unless the customer obtains a multi-site license for its use of the software product or the software product is by its nature a multi-site use product. Software security measures are also employed to prevent unauthorized use of our software products and the licensed software is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized use, distribution, or reproduction. For most products, customers may purchase a perpetual license of the technology with the right to annually purchase ongoing maintenance, technical support and upgrades, or may lease the product on a fixed-term basis for a fee that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades. For some products, customers purchase an annual subscription for a certain number of named users that includes the license, maintenance, technical support and upgrades or purchase elastic units, which enable the use of any supported product at any time until their licensed volume is met.  We license our software products utilizing a combination of web-based and hard-copy license terms and forms. For certain software products, we primarily rely on  click-wrapped  licenses  i.e. online agreements where the website provider posts terms and conditions, and the user clicks on the  accept  button . The enforceability of these types of agreements under the laws of some jurisdictions is uncertain.  We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as registered unpublished copyrighted work. We have obtained federal trademark registration protection for Ansys and other marks in the U.S. and foreign countries. Additionally, we were awarded numerous patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent offices in other jurisdictions and have a number of patent applications pending. To the extent we do not choose to seek patent protection for our intellectual property, we primarily rely on the protection of our source code as a trade secret.  Our employees have signed agreements under which they have agreed not to disclose trade secrets or confidential information. These agreements, where legally permitted, restrict engagement in or connection with any business that is competitive with us anywhere in the world while employed by us  and, in some cases, for specified periods thereafter  and state that any products or technology created by employees during their term of employment are our property. In addition, we require all channel partners to enter into agreements not to disclose our trade secrets and other proprietary information.  Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our technology and proprietary information  including source code  will be prevented. Further, there can be no assurance that copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret protection will be available for our products in certain jurisdictions, or that restrictions on the ability of employees and channel partners to engage in activities competitive with us will be enforceable. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary in the future to enforce our rights to our trade secrets and proprietary information or to enforce our patent rights and copyrights, and it is possible that, in the future, our competitors may be able to obtain our trade secrets or to independently develop similar technology.  The software development industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Therefore, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements, name recognition and reliable product maintenance are also important to establishing and maintaining technology leadership in addition to the various available legal protections of our technology.  We do not believe that any of our products infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors or licensees with respect to current or future products. In addition, there are non-practicing entities  NPEs  and patent assertion entities  PAEs  whose business models are built on not producing any products, but rather extracting payments from revenue-generating companies through patent infringement assertions and or litigation. We expect that software suppliers will increasingly be subject to the risk of such claims as the number of products and suppliers continues to expand and the functionality of products continues to increase. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product release delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us.  SEASONAL VARIATIONS  Our business has experienced seasonality, including quarterly volatility in software sales resulting from slowdowns of customer activities during the summer months, particularly in Europe, as well as from the seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns of  our global customers. Lease and maintenance contract renewals, as well as our revenue, are typically highest in the fourth quarter.  DEFERRED REVENUE AND BACKLOG  Deferred revenue consists of billings made or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from customer agreements. The deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets does not represent the total value of annual or multi-year, noncancellable agreements. Our backlog represents installment billings for periods beyond the current quarterly billing cycle. Our deferred revenue and backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following   Balance at December 31, 2020   in thousands  Total Current Long-Term  Deferred revenue   388,810   372,061   16,749  Backlog 578,317 234,719 343,598  Total   967,127   606,780   360,347  Balance at December 31, 2019   in thousands  Total Current Long-Term  Deferred revenue   365,274   351,353   13,921  Backlog 505,469 218,398 287,071  Total   870,743   569,751   300,992  Revenue associated with deferred revenue and backlog that will be recognized in the subsequent twelve months is classified as current in the tables above.  HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES  At the heart of our culture is a commitment to our people. We believe that our people are one of our most important investments and greatest assets. The success and the growth of our business depend on our ability to attract, develop, incent and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified and highly-skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including our executive officers, and across our global workforce. We have developed key recruitment and retention strategies, objectives and measures that serve as the framework for our human capital management approach. These strategies, objectives and measures are advanced through a number of programs, policies and initiatives, including  promoting diversity, equity and inclusion; employer branding and talent acquisition; ongoing employee development; competitive compensation, including incentives linked to Ansys and the employees performance, and competitive benefits programs providing choice and value to our employees; supporting safety and health; and surveying employee satisfaction and engagement.  As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,800 people, including approximately  1,800 in product development, 2,400 in sales, support and marketing, and 600 in general and administrative functions. Of these employees, 47  were located in the Americas, 28  were located in Europe, Middle East and Africa  EMEA  and 25  were located in Asia-Pacific  APAC . Certain international employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or have local work councils.  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  Diversity, equity and inclusion are key tenets of our culture. We believe diversity at all levels of our organization adds value to our business decision making and innovation by encouraging and incorporating a variety of perspectives and experiences.  As of December 31, 2020, our gender diversity was   Male Female Other Not Indicated  Global employees 73   22   5    Senior leadership team 1   76   24   -    Board of Directors 75   25   -     1 The senior leadership team consists of leaders in our executive career track that report directly to the chief executive officer or within one additional reporting level of the chief executive officer and those at the highest tier of our management career track who report directly to a leader on our executive track. The senior leaders are responsible for directing strategic plans aligned with our corporate strategy through multiple levels of management.  As of December 31, 2020, our ethnic diversity was   White Asian Hispanic or Latino Black or African American Other  Not Indicated  United States-based employees 52   29   2   1   1   15    Board of Directors 62   25   -   13   -   -     Other includes Native Hawaiian, American Indian, Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, or two or more races.  We have a growing number of employee resource groups dedicated to ensuring a culture of inclusion to support our goals of increasing retention of valuable employees and creating an open culture that fuels innovation, including  Women in Tech at Ansys, Ansys Pride Alliance, Black Employee Network at Ansys, Ansys Military Veterans and Families, and most-recently, a group called Accessibility at Ansys. Additionally, we have committed to training 100  of our people managers on inclusive leadership concepts such as unconscious bias, leading to establish belonging, and making objective talent selection decisions.  Employee Recruitment, Development and Retention  Our talent strategy is focused on  i  attracting diverse high-quality talent,  ii  continually developing and engaging our employee base and  iii  retaining our people by recognizing and rewarding performance. Our commitment to recruiting diverse talent is evidenced in the United States through our dedication to increasing recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities, as well as our involvement with minority engineering societies, women in technology groups, veterans organizations and LGBTQ+A organizations. In addition to targeted outreach, we recruit talent through  i  attending career and networking events aimed towards recruiting diverse audiences,  ii  hiring internally through our Ansys internship co-op programs for current students and  iii  value partnerships that promote our programs to diverse audiences. Our academic product suite is also widely used in research and teaching settings, which allows students to become familiar with Ansys simulation software and creates opportunities to strengthen our university ties and recruit fresh talent.  We support the development of our employees by providing professional development and tuition assistance, conducting annual individual assessments, and encouraging feedback on performance. We also drive a variety of focused initiatives specifically designed to support employee development. These include our annual talent reviews and succession planning, emotional intelligence trainings, and company-sponsored education programs, such as management essentials to develop front-line leaders in foundational people management skills.  Developing our employees helps keep employees engaged and excited about their future at Ansys. It also helps mitigate risks associated with employee loss and keeping up with rapid technological and social change. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our annual turnover rate was 6 , and of this, 4  was voluntary.  Compensation and Benefits Program  Our compensation programs provide an opportunity for employees to earn higher compensation by aligning their performance, which may include contributions to our environmental, social and governance objectives, with the overall financial and operational success of Ansys. The program includes three key elements   i  competitive annual salaries,  ii  annual cash incentives and sales commission programs, with a majority of our employees eligible to earn more or less than the target opportunities based on both Ansys and the employees performance and  iii  long-term equity incentives with over half of  employees receiving equity grants each year in the form of time-based restricted stock units and, in the case of senior leadership, time-based restricted stock units and performance stock units that vest, if at all, based on our financial performance and shareholder returns. These grants align the long-term financial interests of our employees with those of our stockholders.  Health and welfare benefit programs include market-competitive benefits comprised of a mix of company-provided and other benefits, including those for medical, dental and vision insurance; life and disability insurance; defined contribution retirement plans; and many different employee assistance programs, such as financial, legal, emotional and social well-being employee assistance programs. Our investments in health and welfare benefits focus on providing choice and value to our employees so they can select market-competitive benefits that support their personal needs.  Local regulations are considered when developing our compensation and benefits packages for employees across the globe.  Safety and Health  The health and safety of our employees and their families, our partners and our broad Ansys community around the world continues to be a high priority. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took action to enable our employees to work from home. We closed our offices  including our corporate headquarters , transitioned to a remote work environment, and implemented certain travel restrictions, each of which has changed how we operate our business. While a number of our offices have since reopened, most of our locations have limited access or have few employees working on site. We are continuing to monitor and manage the situation, but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for the vast majority of our workforce.  We utilize a number of technology platforms to facilitate remote working. Most of these tools were implemented prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and have proven to be instrumental in enabling us to work effectively in this environment. We have also provided our employees with support, including stipends, and in some cases, needed hardware and equipment. In addition, we have implemented many protocols in our offices to keep our employees safe.  Employee Satisfaction and Engagement  Employee feedback and engagement is critical to our success. We conduct global employee engagement surveys with the goal of using the feedback to improve the work environment and employee satisfaction. In 2020, this feedback was critical to understand, as nearly all our employees were required to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Survey results showed that our executive team provided outstanding management and leadership during the pandemic. 96  of employees indicated that they were satisfied with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and 93  reported feeling supported by their immediate manager and their efforts to adapt to the rapidly changing environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Employee feedback is important in the areas of future vision, recognition, communication, leadership, growth and development. Managers communicate results of the survey to their teams and involve employees in the action planning process. The findings from these surveys help us to continually improve performance and engagement. Our 2020 global engagement survey demonstrated that our employees are highly engaged. Our engagement score results indicated that we improved against past performance and also exceeded external benchmarks.  ACQUISITIONS  We make targeted acquisitions in order to support our long-term strategic direction, accelerate innovation, provide increased capabilities to our existing products, supply new products and services, expand our customer base and enhance our distribution channels.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS  The following are important factors we have identified that could affect our future results and an investment in our securities. In addition, from time to time we provide information, including information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that contains forward-looking statements concerning, among other things, projected financial performance, total addressable market, market and industry sector growth, product development and commercialization or other aspects of future operations. Such statements are based on the assumptions and expectations of our management at the time such statements are made. We caution investors that our performance and any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the following   COVID-19 Pandemic Risks  The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an effect on our business, employees, and consolidated financial statements. The uncertainty surrounding the remaining duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic limits our ability to accurately forecast expected business results in the near term.  The health and safety of our employees and their families, our partners and our other constituents around the world is a high priority. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took action to enable our employees to work from home. We closed our offices  including our corporate headquarters , transitioned to a remote work environment, and implemented certain travel restrictions, each of which has changed how we operate our business. While a number of our offices have since reopened, most of our locations have limited access and few employees working on site. We continue to monitor and manage the situation, but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for most of our workforce.  The COVID-19 outbreak and preventative measures taken to contain the COVID-19 outbreak continue to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns in affected areas. A majority of our customer events and those of our channel partners are virtual only experiences. These events may not be as successful as customer events prior to COVID-19 because, among other reasons, the limited number of such events, the varying attendance levels and virtual event fatigue.  An extended period of remote work arrangements negatively impacts the sales pipeline due to reduced, delayed, or altered sales and marketing interactions with customers and potential customers, expose us to increased risk of cyber incidents, delay or alter product roadmaps or research and development due to reduced or limited access to technologies, equipment, or services, and delay or disrupt recruitment efforts. Limitations on availability, ease of use or increased cost related to the use of our products in our customers remote work environments could also result in a decline in demand for our products.  We have experienced, and continue to expect, that our larger customer accounts will perform more strongly than the small- and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic. In addition, the shifting preference from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses was, and is expected to continue to be, elevated as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. There may also be continued lower activity levels in the end markets we service or declining financial performance of our customers and channel partners, which could result in lower rates of renewal, which have historically been stable and high, and cancellations, reductions, or delays for our products and services. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods and could impact future growth rates.  The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and given its inherent uncertainty, we expect the pandemic will continue to have an impact on our business and consolidated financial statements in the near term. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts in the markets where we do business, transmission rates of the virus and the development of virus mutations and variants, the nature and scope of government economic recovery measures and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors section.  Global Operational Risks  We are subject to trade restrictions that could impact our ability to sell to customers and result in liability for violations.  Due to the global nature of our business, we are subject to trade protection laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. For example, we are subject to import and export restrictions and regulations that prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries, regions and persons targeted by the U.S., including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security  BIS  and economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control  OFAC . During the second quarter of 2019, the BIS placed certain entities on its Entity List. Certain of our existing and prospective customers, including Huawei, were included in this list. At the end of the second quarter of 2020, BIS heightened restrictions relating to certain military end uses impacting the use of our semiconductor and electronics software in China, Russia, and Venezuela.  The Entity List and OFAC restrictions limit our ability to deliver products and services to these customers and, in the absence of a license, our ability to sell products and services to these customers in the future. In addition, restrictions implemented by OFAC restrict our ability to sell to, or transact with, restricted individuals, entities, or countries. The inclusion of companies on the Entity List and subjecting companies to the heightened restrictions may encourage them to seek substitute products from competitors whose products are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own products. We cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers. Additionally, other existing and prospective customers may be added to the Entity List and or be subjected to trade restrictions in the future, and such actions may result in other indirect impacts that cannot be quantified, including the imposition of additional trade restrictions on our business by the U.S., China, or other countries. Restrictions on our ability to sell and ship to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.  Our products could be shipped to restricted parties by third parties, including our channel partners. Even though we take measures to ensure that our channel partners comply with all applicable trade restrictions, any failure by channel partners to comply with such restrictions could have negative consequences for us. Violators of trade restrictions may be subject to significant penalties, which may include considerable monetary fines, criminal proceedings against them and their officers and employees, a denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from selling products or services to the federal government. Any such penalties could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation could cause significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing normal day-to-day operations.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.  We develop and sell software and consulting services and maintain support operations in more than 40 countries whose laws and practices differ from one another and are subject to unexpected changes. Furthermore, our business is subject to regulation by various global governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import export controls, securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Managing these geographically diverse operations requires significant attention and resources to ensure compliance.  Our global reach includes countries considered high-risk environments for public corruption. This exposes us to risks associated with violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. To promote compliance, we forbid our agents and employees from engaging in corrupt behavior and have implemented a compliance program to prevent and detect violations of anti-corruption laws. There remains, however, a risk that illegal conduct could occur thereby exposing us to the financial and reputational risks associated with a violation of anti-corruption laws.  Non-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and may result in our inability to provide certain products and services to existing or prospective customers. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, or if customers make claims against us for compensation, our business and consolidated financial statements could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources and an increase in professional fees and costs. Enforcement actions and sanctions could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.  Our business practices with respect to the collection, use and management of personal information could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.  We are subject to the laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions worldwide regarding accessing, processing, sharing, using, storing, transmitting, disclosing and protecting personal data. As regulatory focus on privacy, data and security issues continues to increase and evolve, and as worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal data expand and become more complex, data protection standards continue to become more strict and potential risks related to data processing within our business may intensify.  The General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , which went into effect in May 2018 and governs data privacy practices within the European Economic Area  EEA , applies to our data processing activities within the EEA, as well as the processing of EEA citizen data globally, and imposes various compliance obligations related to the handling of personal data in the delivery of our products and services and to business operations involving employee data. Compliance with the GDPR has and will continue to require deployment of substantial resources and increased costs. If we fail to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4  of annual worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, extensive and prescriptive consent decrees or judgments that may require additional resources or expenses for compliance and may cause reputational damage. As a result of the expiration of the Brexit transition period, on December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the European Union reached a provisional agreement temporarily permitting the continued flow of personal data between the regions. Anticipated further evolution of European Union regulations on this topic, including the impact of Brexit on these regulations in the U.K. and any related changes to the regulatory framework in the U.K., may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. We may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by new regulations and we may be required to make significant changes to our software applications and expanding business operations, all of which may adversely affect our results of operations.  The GDPR restricts transfers of personal data outside of the EEA to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections, including the U.S., unless an appropriate safeguard specified by the GDPR is implemented, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses  SCCs  approved by the European Commission, Binding Corporate Rules, and, until July 16, 2020, the Privacy Shield for EU-U.S. data transfers. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated Privacy Shield, and also opined on compliance obligations for companies relying upon SCCs as their valid basis of transferring personal data outside of the EU. This decision led to uncertainty about the legal basis for personal data transfers out of the EU to the U.S. Potential new rules and restrictions on the transfer of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. This decision could also give rise to operational interruption in the performance of services for customers and internal processing of employee information, regulatory liabilities or reputational harm.  In addition, California implemented the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA  as of January 2020, which requires compliance measures similar to those of the GDPR and establishes the first state standard for a comprehensive set of data privacy rights. The CCPA, among other things, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. In November 2020, California voters passed the California Privacy Rights Act  CPRA . The CPRA, which is expected to take effect on January 1, 2023, significantly expands the CCPA, including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations, granting additional rights to consumers such as correction of personal information and additional opt-out rights, and creates a new agency to implement and enforce the law. Several other states have proposed data privacy laws that would impose obligations on us with respect to how we collect and use personal data, including customer data. To comply with U.S. state laws and any data breach notification laws that vary across states, we may be required to invest in additional resources or tools to manage our data processing activities. If we fail to comply with the requirements of U.S. data privacy and data breach notification laws, we may be subject to state monetary fines, consent decrees issued by the Federal Trade Commission or other regulatory enforcement agencies, and possible reputational damage.  Adverse economic and geopolitical conditions may impact our operations and financial performance.  Our operations and performance depend significantly on global macroeconomic, specific foreign country and U.S. domestic economic conditions. Adverse conditions in the macroeconomic environment may result in a decreased demand for our products and services, constrained credit and liquidity, reduced government spending and volatility in equity and foreign exchange markets. In addition, significant downturns and volatility in the global economy expose us to impairments of certain assets if their values deteriorate. Tighter credit due to economic conditions may diminish our future borrowing ability and increase borrowing costs under our existing credit facilities. Customers' ability to pay for our products and services may also be impaired, which could lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable.  A majority of our business comes from outside the U.S. and our customers supply a wide array of goods and services to most of the worlds major economic regions. International revenue represented 53.8 , 57.9  and 60.9  of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal year 2020, our largest geographic revenue bases were the U.S., Japan and Germany.  When the significant economies in which we do business deteriorate or suffer a period of uncertainty, our business and financial performance may be impacted through reduced customer and government spending, changes in purchasing cycles or timing and reduced access to credit for our customers, among other events. Furthermore, customer spending levels in any foreign jurisdiction may be adversely impacted by changes in domestic policies, including tax and trade policies.  A substantial portion of our license and maintenance revenue is derived from annual lease and maintenance contracts, which typically have a high rate of customer renewal. When the rate of renewal for these contracts is adversely affected by economic or other factors, our lease license and maintenance growth is adversely affected.  Foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.  As a result of our significant international presence, we have revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies, most notably the Euro and Japanese Yen. Our operating results are adversely affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies and are positively affected when the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to foreign currencies. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, certain channel partners who pay us in U.S. Dollars may have trouble paying on time or may have trouble distributing our products due to the impact of the currency exchange fluctuation on their cash flows. This may impact our ability to distribute our products into certain regions and markets.  We seek to reduce our currency exchange transaction risks primarily through our normal operating and treasury activities, including derivative instruments, but there can be no assurance that these activities will be successful in reducing these risks. In addition, we incur transaction fees in the usage of such derivative instruments. Changes in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.  A catastrophic event or infrastructure failure could result in the loss of business and adverse financial consequences.  A significant portion of our personnel, source code and computer equipment is located in each of California, Pennsylvania, British Columbia, India, Japan and throughout Europe. A natural disaster, cyberattack, terrorist act, pandemic, or other unforeseen catastrophe in any of these areas or a breakdown in our business infrastructure, such as an interruption in power supply, telephone system or information technology systems, could cause disruptions to our sales, operations, services and product development activities. As our sales are generally greater at the end of a quarter, the potential adverse effects resulting from any of these events would be accentuated if they occurred at quarter end.  Effective business continuity, disaster recovery and crisis management plans are critical to minimizing the impact of such unplanned or unexpected events. We also face increasing customer certification requirements with respect to such systems. Failure to establish plans that effectively mitigate the impacts of these disruptions or meet customer certification requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.  See The COVID-19 Pandemic portion of this Risk Factors section for a description of the impact of the pandemic on us.  Industry Operational Risks  Our industry is highly competitive, which could result in downward pressure on our prices.  We continue to experience competition across all markets for our products and services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do, and some have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers. Our current and potential competitors also include firms that have competed, or may in the future compete, by means of open source licensing. Companies we have, or could have, strategic alliances with could reduce or discontinue technical, software development and marketing relationships with us for competitive purposes.  If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services, or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may lower prices or offer discounts or other favorable terms to compete successfully. Our maintenance products, which include software license updates and product support fees, are generally priced as a percentage of new software license fees. Our competitors may offer lower percentage pricing on product updates and support. Some competitors may bundle software products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices, product  implementations or wider geographical license usage provisions. Any of these practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain products.  Furthermore, if we do not adapt pricing models to reflect changes in customer usage of our products or changes in customer demand, our software license revenues could decrease. Additionally, increased distribution of applications through application service providers, including software-as-a-service providers, may reduce the average price of our products or adversely affect other sales of our products, reducing new software license revenues unless we can offset price reductions with volume increases.  These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions and or increased operating costs, and could result in lower revenues, margins and net income.  We may not be successful in developing and marketing new products to adequately address the rapidly changing technology industry.  We operate in an industry generally characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent new product introductions, which can render existing products obsolete or unmarketable. A major factor in our future success will be our ability to anticipate technological changes and to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, new products to meet those changes. Our ability to grow revenue will be dependent on our ability to respond to customer needs in the areas of, among others, 5G, autonomous vehicles, IIoT and electrification, and to leverage cloud computing and new computing platforms. In addition, our future success may depend on our ability to continue to develop a systems integrator ecosystem able to handle integrations and process and application development to address the challenge of the increasingly complex integration of our products different functionalities to address customers requirements. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security and integrity of the data transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our business.  We devote substantial resources to research and development, which could cause our operating results to decline.  We devote substantial resources to research and development. New competitors, technological advances in the software development industry by us or our competitors, acquisitions, entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, operating results could decline. In addition, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact financial results.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely basis, new products or product enhancements or that the new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace or that we will successfully manage the transition from existing products. Software products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors, defects or vulnerabilities when first introduced or as new versions are released, and the likelihood of errors, defects or vulnerabilities is increased as a result of our commitment to the frequency of product releases. There can be no assurance that errors, defects or vulnerabilities will not be found in any new or enhanced products after the commencement of commercial shipments. The occurrence of any defects or errors in our products could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products, delays in payment to us by customers, loss of customers or market share, product returns, damage to our reputation, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions, increased insurance costs, and liability for damages.  The price of our common stock is subject to volatility.  The market price of securities of software companies is subject to significant fluctuations. For example, our common stock price ranged from  200.07 to  369.82 per share during 2020. The valuation and trading price of our common stock may not be predictable. Factors that may adversely impact our share price include our failure to meet analyst expectations, reduced expectations regarding financial outlook, increases in our debt levels, changes in management or our material announcements or those of our competitors. In addition, volatility could result from causes that are unrelated to our operating performance such as conditions in the financial markets or the software industry generally.  Company Operational Risks  We are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant percentage of our revenue and usage of channel partners presents certain heightened compliance risks.  We distribute our products through a global network of independent channel partners, which accounted for 22.2 , 22.9  and 22.4  of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Channel partners sell our software products to new and existing customers, expand installations within the existing customer base, offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support. In the APAC and EMEA regions, we are highly dependent upon our channel partners. Difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners, such as failure to meet performance criteria and differences in handling customer relationships, could adversely affect our performance. Additionally, the loss of any major channel partner, including a channel partner's decision to sell competing products rather than ours, could result in reduced revenue. Moreover, our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to dedicate the resources necessary to understand and promote our expanding portfolio of products and to support a larger installed base within each of our geographic regions. If the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so, we may be unable to sustain revenue growth.  We have been increasing the number of our channel partners, particularly in international locations. The business relationships with many of our channel partners are recently established and could result in additional compliance burdens for us. In addition, these new channel partners have a less-established payment history and revenue from these channel partners could come with a higher rate of bad debt expense. Where channel partners operate on our behalf to collect and process personal data of customer contacts, failure to comply with relevant data privacy laws in the handling of such personal data could result in liability to us for any fines, civil suits or non-financial performance obligations imposed by regulatory authorities on these partners with respect to our customer data.  Certain products require a higher level of sales and support expertise. Failure of our sales channel, particularly the independent channel partners, to obtain this expertise and to sell the new product offerings effectively could have an adverse impact on our sales in future periods. Any of these problems may result in the loss of or delay in customer acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.  We may not be able to realize the potential benefit of our acquisitions and such acquisitions could pose risks to our business.  We consummate acquisitions to support our long-term strategic direction. Our 2020 acquisitions included Lumerical and AGI and our 2019 acquisitions included Granta Design, Helic, DfR Solutions, LST and Dynardo.  Each acquisition that we complete may present risks, including  difficulty in integrating the management teams, strategies, cultures and operations of the companies or businesses; failing to achieve anticipated synergies, revenue increases or cost savings; difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines; difficulty with sales, distribution and marketing functions; failure to develop new products and services that utilize the technologies and resources of the companies; disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention to transition or integration issues; liabilities that were not identified during the acquisition process; the loss of our key employees, customers, partners and channel partners or those of the acquired companies or businesses; and cybersecurity and data privacy risks.  Where customer contacts and leads are a significant consideration in the purchase price or expected financial outcome of an acquisition, failure to identify or mitigate data privacy concerns with the collection, use and retention of personal data may adversely impact our ability to use this information as anticipated and regulatory obligations may require that we delete all or a portion of the database, or take additional remediation measures before use. This may impact the value of the acquisition or reduce forecasted sales.  Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant cash resources; the incurrence of debt, which increases our interest expense and leverage; or the issuance of equity, which is dilutive to stockholders and may decrease earnings per share.  We allocate a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets. If we do not realize all the economic benefits of an acquisition, there could be an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. Furthermore, impairment charges are generally not tax-deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period the impairment is recorded.  If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by our management or the financial and industry analysts, there could be a significant adverse effect on our stock price, business and consolidated financial statements.  The ongoing implementation of a new functionality to the existing Customer Relationship Management  CRM  system may not achieve the corporate benefits identified.  We are in the process of implementing new functionality in our existing  CRM  system. While this system is anticipated to automate and deliver operational efficiencies across the demand generation, sales cycle, order processing and customer service phases of the customer journey, to date this project has not achieved the anticipated benefits and there is a risk that the benefits could be further substantially delayed. There is also a risk that we will have to write off previously capitalized expenditures if the project is not successful or if implementation decisions regarding the project are modified. Factors that could further delay the timing of benefits realization include   changes in leadership and project objectives;  additional needs for technical expertise and manpower; and  longer than anticipated time horizon for employee adoption and mastery.  Any of the above could divert efforts of key operational management away from other aspects of the business, including the maintenance of the current CRM platform, and result in increased consulting and software costs. These factors could have a significant negative impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.  If we are unable to attract and retain key talent, our business could be adversely affected.  Our success depends upon the continued service of our senior executives and our key technical and sales employees. Most of these individuals could terminate their relationship with us at any time. The loss of any of them for which there has not been adequate knowledge-sharing and transfer might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships.  In addition, because of the highly technical nature of our products and services, we must attract and retain highly skilled engineering and development personnel. The market for this talent is highly competitive. We have difficulty filling these roles and our talent has been the subject of recruitment by our competitors. While we have non-competition and non-solicitation agreements with many of these individuals, the enforceability of these agreements may be limited by courts.  While we have historically recruited globally for positions in the U.S., in recent years our ability to do so has been curbed by more restrictive domestic immigration laws. If the immigration laws become even stricter or the processing of immigration requests becomes even more cumbersome or less efficient, or if we have less success in recruiting and retaining key personnel, our business, reputation and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.  We may be subject to proceedings that could harm our business.  We are subject to various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits and litigations, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. Use or distribution of our products could generate product liability, regulatory infraction, or similar claims by our customers, end users, channel partners, government entities or other third parties. Sales and marketing activities that impact processing of personal data, as well as measures taken to ensure license compliance, may also result in claims by customers and individual employees of customers. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements as well as cause reputational damage.  We may suffer reputational or financial harm if we have product standard or quality issues.  We have separate quality systems and registrations under the ISO 9001 2015 standard in addition to other governmental and industrial regulations. Our continued compliance with quality standards and favorable outcomes in periodic examinations is important to retain current customers and vital to procure new sales. If it was determined that we were not in compliance with various regulatory or ISO 9001 standards, our certificates of registration could be suspended, requiring remedial action and a time-consuming re-registration process. Product quality issues or failures could result in our reputation becoming diminished, resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.  Our short-term and long-term sales forecast may not be accurate, which could result in an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.  The software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. These long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. Many operational and strategic decisions are based upon short- and long-term sales  forecasts. Our sales personnel continually monitor the status of proposals, including the estimated closing date and the value of the sale, in order to forecast quarterly sales. These forecasts are subject to significant estimation and are impacted by many external factors, including global economic conditions and the performance of our customers. The heightened uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic results in greater ranges and variability of these forecasts.  A variation in actual sales activity from that forecasted could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. Management also forecasts macroeconomic trends and developments and integrates them through long-range planning into budgets, research and development strategies and a wide variety of general management duties. Global economic conditions, and the effect those conditions and any disruptions in global markets have on our customers, may have a significant impact on the accuracy of our sales forecasts. These conditions may increase the likelihood or the magnitude of variations between actual sales activity and our sales forecasts and, as a result, our performance may be hindered because of a failure to properly match corporate strategy with economic conditions. This, in turn, could have a significant adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. To the extent our forecasts are incorrect and, as a result, we fail to meet analyst expectations regarding financial performance or miss or reduce the financial guidance we give to investors, our share price may be adversely impacted.  Intellectual Property Risks  Our success is highly dependent upon the legal protection of our proprietary technology.  We primarily rely upon contracts, copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secrets laws to protect our technology. We maintain intellectual property programs, including applying for patents, registering trademarks and copyrights, protecting trade secrets, entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and channel partners, and limiting access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. However, software programs are particularly prone to piracy, which is a global phenomenon, and as a result we may lose revenue from piracy or usage and distribution of unlicensed software. Additionally, patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection do not provide the same coverage in every country in which we sell our products and services. Policing the unauthorized distribution and use of our products is difficult, and software piracy  including online piracy  is a persistent problem. While we continue to develop better mechanisms to detect and report or investigate unauthorized use of our software, we are also constrained by data privacy laws that restrict our ability to collect data about unlawful usage in some countries. We cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology are adequate to prevent misappropriation of our software by third parties, or that third parties will not copy our technology or develop similar technology independently to compete with our products. Despite our efforts to prevent such activities, we may nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software or technology.  Costly and time-consuming litigation would be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions across our contractual agreements and partnerships. In addition, third parties may subject us to infringement claims with respect to their intellectual property rights. Any such litigation could be costly to defend, damage our reputation, and distract our employees from their daily work. Any successful infringement claims asserted against us could require us to develop technology workarounds for the impacted technologies, products, or solutions, which could be costly, disrupt product development, and delay go-to-market activities. Such disruption and delay could negatively impact our financial results.  We may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results.  We license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. We also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our solutions and professional services. These licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. Third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors who elect to terminate our contractual relationship. If we are unable to obtain licenses to such third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers usage of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers' ability to utilize our software, and our reputation.  Cybersecurity Risks  Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation.  While we undertake commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and improve the security and integrity of our products, source code, computer systems and data with respect to the relative sensitivity of such software, systems and data, the number of computer hackers developing and deploying destructive software programs that attack our products and computer systems continues to increase. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity efforts. Because the tactics and tools used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems are constantly evolving, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our products, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, or allow unauthorized access to and disclosure of our sensitive, proprietary or confidential information or that of our customers and employees. In the event of a serious breach of our products or systems, or where a breach occurs due to our failure to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards, our reputation may suffer, customers may stop buying products or may terminate current services, we could face lawsuits and potential civil liability, as well as regulatory fines and non-financial penalties for any personal data breach, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.  There is also a danger of industrial espionage, cyberattacks, misuse, theft of information or assets  including source code , or damage to assets by people who have gained unauthorized access to our facilities, systems or information. This includes access to systems or information through email phishing attacks on our employees which has become a very prevalent technique used against companies, often delaying detection through increasingly complex practices. The objective of these attacks is often to acquire user account credentials in order to access other computer systems through linked accounts or where users have recycled passwords across systems. Additionally, the recent attack against SolarWinds, in which hackers inserted malware into a SolarWinds software update, highlights the growing risk from the infection of software while it is under assembly, known as a supply chain attack. As a software provider, we could become a vector for a similar style attack or could become the subject of one through a supply chain compromise.  Inadequate security practices or inadvertent acts or omissions by our employees and partners may also result in unauthorized access to our data. Employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our or our customers security or systems. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse of data or other disruptions could lead to loss of or unauthorized disclosure of our source code or other confidential information, unlicensed use and distribution of our products without compensation, illegal use of our products that could jeopardize the security of customer information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems, and theft, manipulation and destruction of proprietary data, resulting in defective products, performance downtimes and possible violation of export laws and other regulatory compliance requirements. Although we actively employ measures to combat such activities, preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data is inherently difficult. In addition, litigation to either pursue our legal rights or defend any claims against us could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management's attention and adversely affect the market's perception of us and our products.  We have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity attacks and incidents in the past that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information and systems, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. To date, no cybersecurity incident or attack has had a material impact on our business or consolidated financial statements.  A number of our core processes, such as software development, sales and marketing, customer service and financial transactions, rely on IT infrastructure and applications. We also rely on third-party service providers and products, which are exposed to various security vulnerabilities outside of our control. Malicious software, sabotage and other cybersecurity breaches of the types discussed above could cause an outage of our infrastructure, which could cause short-term disruption in operations or, in the event of a longer disruption, lead to a substantial denial of service to our customers and ultimately to production downtime, recovery costs and customer claims for breach of contract, as well as reputational damage and impact to employee morale and productivity.  We rely on service providers for infrastructure and cloud-based products.  We use a number of third-party service providers, which we do not control, for key components of our infrastructure, particularly with respect to development and delivery of our cloud-based products. The utilization of these service providers gives us greater flexibility in efficiently delivering a more tailored, scalable customer experience, but also exposes us to additional risks and vulnerabilities. Third-party service providers operate their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time as a result of problems with our third-party service providers infrastructure. Lack of availability of this infrastructure could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks that we cannot predict or prevent. Such outages could lead to the triggering of our service level agreements and  the issuance of credits to our cloud-based product customers, which may impact our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, those of our products and services that depend upon hosted components are vulnerable to security risks inherent in web-based technologies, including greater risk of unauthorized access to or use of customers protected data. Interception of data transmission, misappropriation or modification of data, corruption of data and attacks by bad actors against our service providers may also adversely affect our products or product and service delivery. Malicious code, viruses or vulnerabilities that are undetected by our service providers may disrupt our business operations generally and may have a disproportionate effect on those of our products that are developed and delivered in the cloud environment. If our security, or that of any of our third-party service providers, is compromised, our software is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our software within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.  These risks, though largely outside our control, may impact customer perception of our products, service and support, and may damage our brand. While we devote resources to maintaining the security and integrity of our products and systems, as well as ensuring adequate due diligence for our third-party service providers, cloud security and reliability is inherently challenging. In the event of a material breach of data hosted by our service providers or a serious security incident on behalf of, caused by or experienced by a service provider, we may experience significant operational and technical difficulties, loss of data including customer data, diminished competitive position or reputation, and loss of customer engagement, which could result in civil liabilities and a negative impact to financial performance. It is also possible that our customers and potential customers would hold us accountable for any breach of security affecting a third-party service providers infrastructure and we may incur significant liability from those customers and from third parties with respect to any breach affecting these systems. We may not be able to recover a material portion of our liabilities to our customers and third parties from a third-party cloud provider.  Financial Risks  Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In connection with our acquisitions of AGI and LST, we have outstanding borrowings of  375.0 million and  425.0 million, respectively, under term loan facilities which mature on November 1, 2024. We also have access to a  500.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a  50.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. The credit agreements governing these loans contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The credit agreements also contain a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization not exceeding 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter  for the four-quarter period ending on such date  with an opportunity for a temporary increase in such consolidated leverage ratio to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the consummation of certain qualified acquisitions for which the aggregate consideration is at least  250.0 million.  Notwithstanding the limits contained in the credit agreements governing our term loan facilities and credit facility, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our level of debt could   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and other ongoing business obligations, which may result in defaults;  result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement governing our debt, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable or require us to negotiate an amendment to financial or other covenants that could cause us to incur additional fees and expenses;  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;  reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions;  expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, and the overall economy;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;  increase our cost of borrowing; and  increase our effective tax rate as interest expense could become non-deductible  Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt agreements.  Furthermore, borrowings under the credit agreement use the London Interbank Offering Rate  LIBOR  as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR has been the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, and the financial industry is currently transitioning away from LIBOR as a benchmark for the interbank lending market. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.  Changes to tax laws, variable tax estimates and tax authority audits could impact our financial results and operations.  Our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the U.S. and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. A change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, or a decrease in tax rates in a jurisdiction in which we have significant deferred tax assets, could result in a material increase in tax expense. Furthermore, we have recorded significant deferred tax liabilities related to acquired intangible assets that are not deductible for tax purposes. These deferred tax liabilities are based on future statutory tax rates in the locations in which the intangible assets are recorded. Any future changes in statutory tax rates would be recorded as an adjustment to the deferred tax liabilities in the period the change is announced and could have a material impact on our effective tax rate during that period.  We also make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision. These estimates involve complex tax regulations in many jurisdictions and are subject to many transactions and calculations in which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The outcome of tax matters could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and related accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the periods in which such determinations are made.  The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. These audits can result in additional assessments, including interest and penalties. Our estimates for liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions is highly judgmental and actual future outcomes may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities, including estimates for uncertain tax positions, in the period the assessments are made or resolved, audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Business  Ansys, a Delaware corporation formed in 1994, develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a broad spectrum of industries and academia, including aerospace and defense, automotive, electronics, semiconductors, energy, materials and chemical processing, turbomachinery, consumer products, healthcare, and sports. Headquartered south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we employed approximately 4,800 people as of December 31, 2020. We focus on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing and validation. We distribute our suite of simulation technologies through direct sales offices in strategic, global locations and a global network of independent resellers and distributors  collectively, channel partners . It is our intention to continue to maintain this hybrid sales and distribution model.  Our strategy of Pervasive Engineering Simulation seeks to deepen the use of simulation in our core, to inject simulation throughout the product lifecycle and to embed simulation into our partners' ecosystems. The engineering software simulation market is strong and growing. Its market growth is driven by customers need for rapid, quality innovation in a cost efficient manner, enabling faster time to market of new products and lower warranty costs. While the transition away from physical prototyping toward simulation is prevalent through all industries, its demand is heightened by investments in high-growth solutions, including 5G, electrification, autonomous and the IIoT. Our strategy of Pervasive Engineering Simulation is aligned with the market growth.  We license our technology to businesses, educational institutions and governmental agencies. Growth in our revenue is affected by the strength of global economies, general business conditions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of our products. We believe that the features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products are as strong as they have ever been. However, the software business is generally characterized by long sales cycles. These long sales cycles increase the difficulty of predicting sales for any particular quarter. We make many operational and strategic decisions based upon short- and long-term sales forecasts that are impacted not only by these long sales cycles, but also by current global economic conditions, including the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe that our overall performance is best measured by fiscal year results rather than by quarterly results. Please see the sub-section entitled  Company Operational Risks  under Part I. Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of the potential impact of our sales forecasts on our financial condition, cash flows and operating results.  Management considers the competition and price pressure that it faces in the short- and long-term by focusing on expanding the breadth, depth, ease of use and quality of the technologies, features, functionality and integrated multiphysics capabilities of our software products as compared to our competitors; investing in research and development to develop new and innovative products and increase the capabilities of our existing products; supplying new products and services; focusing on customer needs, training, consulting and support; and enhancing our distribution channels. We also consider acquisitions to supplement our global engineering talent, product offerings and distribution channels.  Overview   Impact of COVID-19  We are continuing to closely monitor the spread of COVID-19 and have employed measures to mitigate its potential effects on our business as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and our employees.  The health and safety of our employees and their families, our partners and our broad Ansys community around the world is a high priority. At the onset of the crisis, we took action to enable our employees to work from home. We closed our offices  including our corporate headquarters , transitioned to a remote work environment and implemented certain travel restrictions, each of which have disrupted how we operate our business. We are continuing to monitor the situation, but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for a majority of our workforce. Remote work arrangements have not adversely affected our ability to maintain effective financial operations, including our financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We expect to maintain these effective controls as we continue to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The impact from the rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the business of our customers and partners, and has impacted our business and consolidated results of operations. Our current expectations regarding future performance are subject to significant uncertainty and dependent upon how widespread the virus  becomes, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the geographic markets affected, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the spread of the virus, including the shelter-in-place orders, the nature and scope of government economic recovery measures and other factors. The spread of the virus and economic deterioration caused by the virus have had an adverse impact on our business and, in the future, could have a material adverse impact on our business, as well as on our ability to achieve our financial guidance. We continue to adjust our spending to reflect our expectations for the pace at which economic recovery will occur, while balancing the need to invest for the long-term opportunity. We have also maintained and intend to maintain our commitment to invest in our acquisitions, R D and certain digital transformation projects, in particular our CRM and human resources information system  HRIS  projects, as those projects are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and scale the business for future growth. During 2020, we onboarded our partner community in CRM and we implemented several HRIS modules, including remote on-boarding. In addition, we continue to strategically invest in research and development, enabling us to stay on track with our product release targets.  Please see  Risk Factors  under Part I. Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion on additional business risks, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Overall GAAP and Non-GAAP Results  This section includes a discussion of GAAP and Non-GAAP results. For reconciliations of Non-GAAP results to GAAP results, see the section titled  Non-GAAP Results  herein.  Our GAAP and non-GAAP results for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 reflected the following variances   Year Ended December 31, 2020  GAAP Non-GAAP  Revenue 10.9   10.9    Operating income  3.6    5.3    Diluted earnings per share  5.3    1.8    We experienced an increase in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to growth in lease licenses, maintenance and service revenue and contributions from our recent acquisitions, partially offset by reductions in perpetual license revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic and trade restrictions with China adversely impacted our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 with the most pronounced reductions occurring in perpetual licenses. However, due to our diverse customer base, both from a vertical and geographic perspective, as well as the close relationships with customers, we were able to conduct a large amount of business remotely, which partially mitigated the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.  We also experienced increased operating expenses primarily due to increased personnel costs, higher stock-based compensation and additional operating expenses related to acquisitions. While our hiring pace was slowed and certain discretionary operational expenses, such as travel, were reduced, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020.  The non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, transaction expenses related to business combinations, and adjustments related to the transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Impact of Foreign Currency  Our comparative financial results were impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The net favorable impacts on our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue and operating income as a result of the weakened U.S. Dollar when measured against our primary foreign currencies are reflected in the table below.  Year Ended December 31, 2020   in thousands  GAAP Non-GAAP  Revenue   16,841   16,775  Operating income   11,986   12,211  In constant currency, our variances were as follows   Year Ended December 31, 2020  GAAP Non-GAAP  Revenue 9.8   9.8    Operating income  6.0    3.5    Constant currency amounts exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2020 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2019 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2020. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2020 reported revenue and operating income amounts by the 2020 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing to the 2019 comparable period reported revenue and operating income amounts.  Other Key Business Metric  Annual Contract Value  ACV  is one of our key performance metrics and is useful to investors in assessing the strength and trajectory of our business. Given that revenue is variable due to the upfront revenue recognition of multi-year lease license sales, we provide ACV as a supplemental metric to help evaluate the annual performance of the business. Summed over the long term, ACV and revenue lead to similar outcomes. However, there will be years where ACV growth lags revenue growth and other years where ACV growth leads revenue growth. It is used by management in financial and operational decision-making and in setting sales targets used for compensation. ACV should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ACV is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following   the annualized value of maintenance and lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus  the value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plus  the annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plus  the value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts.  Our ACV was as follows   Year Ended December 31, Change   in thousands, except percentages  2020 2019 Amount   Constant Currency    ACV   1,616,301   1,461,759   154,542 10.6 9.3  Recurring ACV as a percentage of ACV 82.0   77.4    Recurring ACV is composed of both lease licenses and maintenance contracts. The increase in recurring ACV reflected for the year ended December 31, 2020 has been driven by a meaningful reduction in perpetual licenses and an increased preference for lease licenses, due in part to the impacts of COVID-19.  While the resilience of our business is evident in the growth shown above, the economic conditions due to the COVID-19 outbreak have disrupted the business of our customers and partners, and have adversely impacted our business and consolidated results. In addition, trade discussions between the U.S. and China led to certain entities being placed on a restricted entity list. These restrictions limited our ability to deliver products and services to these customers. The 2019 operating results include approximately  20.0 million of ACV related to transactions that occurred prior to the placement of the restrictions. These restrictions remained in place throughout 2020.  Other Financial Information  Our financial position includes  913.2 million in cash and short-term investments, and working capital of  990.4 million as of December 31, 2020.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 0.7 million shares for  161.0 million at an average price of  233.48 per share under our stock repurchase program, all of which occurred during the first quarter. As of December 31, 2020, we had 2.8 million shares remaining available for repurchase under our authorized share repurchase program.  Geographic Trends  The following table presents our geographic constant currency revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019   Year Ended December 31, 2020  Americas 21.2    Europe, Middle East and Africa  EMEA  3.8    Asia-Pacific  2.1     Total 9.8    To drive growth, we continue to focus on a number of sales improvement activities across the geographic regions, including sales hiring, pipeline building, productivity initiatives and customer engagement activities.  Continued trade tensions between the U.S. and China, together with the uncertainty around the COVID-19 outbreak, may further restrict our ability to sell and distribute our products to certain customers and our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Refer to additional details in  Risk Factors  under Part I. Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K  Industry Commentary   Our three largest industries - high-tech, automotive and aerospace and defense  A D  - remained strong throughout 2020 as companies accelerate their digital transformation initiatives. The high-tech industry was positively impacted by companies' continued investments in the development of the next generation of increasingly complex chips and technology to support the applications of 5G, autonomy and other high growth areas. The automotive industry maintained its growth through the development of electrification and autonomous technologies. While the commercial aviation sector continues to be significantly impacted by the dramatic reduction in demand for global air travel, the continued needs of national security ensure that the defense segment has remained strong and buoyed our overall performance in the aerospace and defense industry.  Acquisitions  We make targeted acquisitions in order to support our long-term strategic direction, accelerate innovation, provide increased capabilities to our existing products, supply new products and services, expand our customer base and enhance our distribution channels.

The growth rate was favorably impacted by our continued investments in our global sales, support and marketing organizations, the timing and duration of our multi-year lease contracts, and our 2020 and 2019 acquisitions product sales contributed incremental revenue of  84.9 million. The growth rate was negatively impacted by the trade restrictions between the United States and China, and the impact of COVID-19. Lease license revenue increased 23.2 , or 21.3  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Annual maintenance contracts that were sold with new perpetual licenses, maintenance contracts for new perpetual licenses sold in previous years and the maintenance portion of lease license contracts collectively contributed to maintenance revenue growth of 10.5 , or 9.8  in constant currency. Service revenue, driven primarily by a focus on service offerings that provide mentorship on simulation best practices, training and expanding simulation adoption, increased 7.5 , or 6.8  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Perpetual license revenue, which is derived primarily from new sales during the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased 4.4 , or 5.4  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.  We continue to experience increased interest by some of our larger customers in enterprise agreements that often include longer-term, time-based licenses involving a larger number of our software products. While these arrangements typically involve a higher overall transaction price, the upfront recognition of license revenue related to these larger, multi-year transactions can result in significantly higher lease license revenue volatility. Software products, across a large variety of applications and industries, are increasingly distributed in software-as-a-service, cloud and other subscription environments in which the licensing approach is time-based rather than perpetual, resulting in shifting preferences from perpetual licenses to time-based licenses across a broader spectrum of our customers. This dynamic was elevated in 2020 as a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19, and we expect it to continue into the foreseeable future.  In relation to COVID-19 and our revenue, we currently expect a recovery in the business environment as reliable vaccines become more readily available. Globally, businesses have not resumed full operations and our teams and those of our customers will likely continue working remotely into 2021. As a result of social distancing, our in-person demand generation events and those of our channel partners have been canceled. While we have adjusted to have a stronger digital focus, as evidenced by our hosting of our annual sales conference virtually in January, the absence of certain events has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our results, especially for certain channel partners. In addition, we have experienced delays in the timing of closing certain transactions, including large enterprise-type deals. These deals are often multi-year leases which have a significant impact on our operating results due to up-front revenue recognition of the license. We expect this trend to continue and anticipate that customers will delay certain purchases, reduce the size of planned purchases or forgo purchases that otherwise were expected to occur. Additional waves or mutated variants of COVID-19 could result in renewed shutdowns that stop or regress economic recovery.  With respect to revenue, on average for the year ended December 31, 2020, the U.S. Dollar was approximately 2.4  weaker, when measured against our primary foreign currencies, than for the year ended December 31, 2019. The table below presents the impacts of currency fluctuations on revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Amounts in brackets indicate a net adverse impact from currency fluctuations.   in thousands  Year Ended December 31, 2020  Euro   11,803  Japanese Yen 4,067  Taiwan Dollar 1,376  British Pound 1,078  Indian Rupee  1,294   Other  189   Total   16,841  The impacts from currency fluctuations resulted in increased operating income of  12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.  As a percentage of revenue, our international and domestic revenues, and our direct and indirect revenues, were as follows   Year Ended December 31,  2020 2019  International 53.8   57.9    Domestic 46.2   42.1    Direct 77.8   77.1    Indirect 22.2   22.9    In valuing deferred revenue on the balance sheets of our recent acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates, we applied the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, resulting in a reduction of deferred revenue as compared to the historical carrying amount. As a result, our post-acquisition revenue will be less than the sum of what would have otherwise been reported by us and each acquiree absent the acquisitions. The impacts on reported revenue were  14.2 million and  12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The expected impacts on reported revenue are  9.0 million and  19.5 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 and the year ending December 31, 2021, respectively.  Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses   The tables below reflect our operating results as presented on the consolidated statements of income, which are inclusive of foreign currency translation impacts. Amounts included in the discussions that follow each table are provided in constant currency and are inclusive of costs related to our acquisitions. The impact of foreign exchange translation is discussed separately, where material. The 2020 and 2019 acquisitions contributed  57.9 million to the overall increase in cost of sales and operating expenses, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, with the most significant contribution from LST  acquired November 1, 2019  of  37.9 million.

Amortization  The increase in amortization expense was due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.  Maintenance and Service  The net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following   Increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of  15.8 million.  Increased third-party technical support of  7.1 million.  Increased stock-based compensation of  5.1 million.  Increased consulting costs of  2.7 million.  Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of  1.5 million.  Increased costs related to foreign exchange translation of  1.1 million due to a weaker U.S. Dollar.  Decreased business travel of  2.2 million due to COVID-19.  The improvement in gross profit was a result of the increase in revenue, partially offset by the increase in the related cost of  sales.

Increased stock-based compensation of  12.9 million.  Increased third-party commissions of  8.4 million.  Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of  5.2 million.  Increased bad debt expense of  3.5 million due to expected losses related to COVID-19.  Increased marketing expenses of  3.0 million.  Increased costs related to foreign exchange translation of  2.8 million due to a weaker U.S. Dollar.  Decreased business travel of  16.0 million due to COVID-19.  We anticipate that we will continue to make targeted investments in our global sales and marketing organizations and our global business infrastructure to enhance and support our revenue-generating activities.  Research and Development  The increase in research and development costs was primarily due to the following   Increased salaries and other headcount-related costs of  38.0 million.  Increased stock-based compensation of  11.4 million.  Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of  4.4 million.  We have traditionally invested significant resources in research and development activities and intend to continue to make investments in expanding the ease of use and capabilities of our broad portfolio of simulation software products, even with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.  Interest Income  Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  5.1 million as compared to  12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest income decreased as a result of a lower interest rate environment and the related decrease in the average rate of return on invested cash balances.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  11.0 million as compared to  3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense increased as a result of the interest incurred on debt financing obtained in connection with the acquisitions of AGI and LST in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Other Income  Expense , net  Our other income  expense  consisted of the following   Year Ended December 31,   in thousands  2020 2019  Investment gains, net   3,648   333  Foreign currency losses, net  194   2,510   Other 30 385  Total other income  expense , net   3,484    1,792   Income Tax Provision  Our income before income tax provision, income tax provision and effective tax rate were as follows   Year Ended December 31,   in thousands, except percentages  2020 2019  Income before income tax provision   493,925   522,583  Income tax provision   60,038   71,288  Effective tax rate 12.2   13.6    The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits of  7.5 million related to entity structuring activities and increased benefits from research and development credits of  4.1 million. These benefits were partially offset by decreased benefits of  6.1 million in the foreign-derived intangible income  FDII  deduction and the decrease in releases of valuation allowance of  2.6 million.  When compared to the federal and state combined statutory rate for each respective period, the effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were also favorably impacted by tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the FDII deduction, and research and development credits.

Amortization  The net decrease in amortization expense was primarily due to a decrease in the amortization of trade names and acquired technology due to assets that became fully amortized, which was partially offset by the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets.  Maintenance and Service  The net increase in maintenance and service costs was primarily due to the following   Increased salaries of  4.0 million.  Increased stock-based compensation of  3.3 million.  Increased consulting costs of  1.7 million.  Increased IT maintenance and software hosting costs of  1.3 million.  Decreased costs related to foreign exchange translation of  2.0 million due to a stronger U.S. Dollar.

Interest Income  Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was  12.8 million as compared to  11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income increased as a result of an increase in the average rate of return on invested cash balances.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was  3.5 million as compared to  0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We use non-GAAP financial measures  a  to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors,  b  to set internal sales targets and spending budgets,  c  to allocate resources,  d  to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting,  e  to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and  f  as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP  financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.  While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.  The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below   Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. In accordance with the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, acquired deferred revenue is often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that is lower than the historical carrying value. Although this acquisition accounting requirement has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to  a  evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and  b  compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.  Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to  a  evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and  b  compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.  Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense  benefit  incurred in connection with our deferred compensation plan held in a rabbi trust includes an offsetting benefit  charge  recorded in other income  expense . Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. We similarly exclude income  expense  related to assets held in a rabbi trust in connection with our deferred compensation plan. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation and income  expense  related to assets held in the deferred compensation plan rabbi trust during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to  a  evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and  b  review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.  Transaction expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. These expenses are generally not tax-deductible. We exclude these acquisition-related transaction expenses, derived from announced acquisitions, for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to  a  evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and  b  review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We recorded impacts to our income tax provision related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, specifically for the transition tax related to unrepatriated cash. We exclude these impacts for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as  i  the charges are not expected to recur as part of our normal operations and  ii  the charges resulted from the extremely infrequent event of major U.S. tax reform, the last such reform having occurred in 1986. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to  a  evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and  b  review historical comparability in our financial reporting.  Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate  AETR  to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we will re-evaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.  Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below   GAAP Reporting Measure Non-GAAP Reporting Measure  Revenue Non-GAAP Revenue  Gross Profit Non-GAAP Gross Profit  Gross Profit Margin Non-GAAP Gross Profit Margin  Operating Income Non-GAAP Operating Income  Operating Profit Margin Non-GAAP Operating Profit Margin  Net Income Non-GAAP Net Income  Diluted Earnings Per Share Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, Change   in thousands, except percentages  2020 2019 Amount    Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments   913,151   872,382   40,769 4.7  Working capital   990,412   860,340   130,072 15.1  Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments  Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments such as money market funds and deposits held at major banks. Short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries with original maturities of three months to one year. The following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments   As of December 31,   in thousands, except percentages  2020   of Total 2019   of Total  Domestic   582,882 63.8   626,433 71.8  Foreign 330,269 36.2 245,949 28.2  Total   913,151   872,382  In general, it is our intention to permanently reinvest all earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts. Substantially all of the pre-2018 earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries were taxed through the transition tax and post-2018 current earnings are taxed as part of global intangible low-taxed income tax expense. These taxes increase our previously taxed earnings and allow for the repatriation of the majority of our foreign earnings without any residual U.S. federal tax. While we believe that the financial reporting bases may be greater than the tax bases of investments in foreign subsidiaries for any earnings in excess of previously taxed amounts, such amounts are considered permanently reinvested. The cumulative temporary difference related to such permanently reinvested earnings is approximately  93.0 million and we would anticipate the tax effect on those earnings to be immaterial.  The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  Year Ended December 31, Change   in thousands  2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 2019 vs. 2018  Net cash provided by operating activities   547,310   499,936   484,988   47,374   14,948  Fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019  Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the current fiscal year due to increased net income  net of non-cash operating adjustments  of  25.8 million and increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of  21.6 million. The growth in net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by strong customer receipts in the fourth quarter, including both the recovery of payments delayed from earlier in the year due to COVID-19, as well as the receipt of payments that were scheduled to be received in 2021. The growth was further aided by our ability to delay certain income, employment and indirect tax payments to 2021. Despite the strong cash flow, as the COVID-19 crisis lengthens, we continue to experience longer-term payment requests, particularly related to larger contract commitments.  Fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the prior fiscal year due to increased net income  net of non-cash operating adjustments  of  107.4 million, partially offset by decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of  92.4 million.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  Year Ended December 31, Change   in thousands  2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 2019 vs. 2018  Net cash used in investing activities    614,253     833,548     312,231    219,295    521,317   Fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019  Net cash used in investing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to decreased acquisition-related net cash outlays of  214.9 million and decreased capital expenditures of  9.6 million. We currently plan capital spending of  30.0 million to  40.0 million during fiscal year 2021 as compared to the  35.4 million that was spent in fiscal year 2020. The level of spending will depend on various factors, including the growth of the business, general economic conditions and the on going impact of COVID-19.  Fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  Net cash used in investing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased acquisition-related net cash outlays of  504.2 million and increased capital expenditures of  23.2 million.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  Year Ended December 31, Change   in thousands  2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 2019 vs. 2018  Net cash provided by  used in  financing activities   96,597   429,409    262,675     332,812    692,084  Fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019  Net cash provided by financing activities decreased during the current fiscal year due primarily to  500.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt incurred in fiscal year 2019 related to the LST acquisition, of which  75.0 million was repaid in 2020 prior to its maturity date, increased stock repurchases of  101.9 million, and increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of  28.6 million, partially offset by  375.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt incurred in fiscal year 2020 related to the AGI acquisition.  Fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018  Net cash provided by financing activities increased during the prior fiscal year due primarily to  500.0 million in proceeds from long-term debt incurred in fiscal year 2019 related to the LST acquisition and decreased stock repurchases of  210.7 million, partially offset by increased restricted stock withholding taxes paid in lieu of issuing shares of  13.6 million.  Other Commitments - Term Loan Facilities and Operating Lease Obligations  As of December 31, 2020, the carrying values of our term loans were  798.1 million, which is net of  1.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. Borrowings under the term loans accrue interest at the Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or at the base rate, at our election. The base rate is the applicable margin plus the highest of  i  the federal funds rate plus 0.500 ,  ii  the Bank of America prime rate and  iii  the Eurodollar rate plus 1.000 . The applicable margin for these borrowings is a percentage per annum based on the lower of  1  a pricing level determined by our then-current consolidated leverage ratio and  2  a pricing level determined by our debt ratings  if such debt ratings exist . The scheduled maturities of the term loans are as follows    in thousands   2021   -  2022 18,750  2023 37,500  2024 743,750  2025 -  Total   800,000  We previously entered into noncancellable operating lease commitments, primarily for our domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment. The commitments related to these operating leases are as follows    in thousands   2021   27,311  2022 24,712  2023 21,522  2024 20,264  2025 17,076  Thereafter 50,438  Total   161,323  Other Cash Flow Information  We believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances of  912.7 million, together with cash generated from operations and access to the  500.0 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. Our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through additional equity or debt financings. However, future disruptions in the capital markets could make financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  We also believe that our liquidity will allow us to manage the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future. However, our 2020 operating cash flow benefited from cash receipts from customer payments originally scheduled to be paid in FY 2021, as well as customer receipts from December transactions that would have traditionally been paid in the following fiscal year. These activities collectively increased our FY 2020 operating cash flow and will decrease our FY 2021 operating cash flow by approximately  25.0 million. Additionally, FY 2020 operating cash flow benefited from  31.0 million related to the timing of various tax payments,  14.0 million of which will be due in 2021, resulting in a further shifting of operating cash flow between these two periods.  Under our stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares as follows   Year Ended December 31,   in thousands, except per share data  2020 2019 2018  Number of shares repurchased 690 330 1,674  Average price paid per share   233.48   179.41   161.12  Total cost   161,029   59,116   269,801  All of the shares of common stock repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2020 were repurchased in the first quarter. As of December 31, 2020, 2.8 million shares remained available for repurchase under the program.  The authorized repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and the pace of the repurchase activity will depend on factors such as working capital needs, cash requirements for acquisitions, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  We continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities and believe that the best uses of our excess cash are to invest in the business; acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, services and technologies; and make payments on our outstanding debt balances. Any future acquisitions may be funded by available cash and investments, cash generated from operations, debt financing, or the issuance of additional securities. Additionally, we have in the past, and expect in the future, to repurchase stock in order to both offset dilution and return capital, in excess of our requirements, to stockholders with the goal of increasing stockholder value.  Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any special-purpose entities or off-balance-sheet arrangements.  Contractual Obligations  Our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are summarized below   Payments Due by Period   in thousands  Total Within 1 year 2 - 3 years 4 - 5 years After 5 years  Long-term debt   Principal payments   800,000   -   56,250   743,750   -  Interest payments 1   45,153 12,198 23,787 9,168 -  Global headquarters operating lease 2   40,735 4,464 8,928 9,130 18,213  Other operating leases 3   120,588 22,847 37,306 28,210 32,225  Unconditional purchase obligations 4   74,925 44,865 27,509 2,551 -  Obligations related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties 5   - - - - -  Other long-term obligations 6   66,427 34,177 15,132 7,002 10,116  Total contractual obligations   1,147,828   118,551   168,912   799,811   60,554   1 Interest on the long-term debt is estimated using the interest rate as of December 31, 2020, as the interest rate is variable. For additional information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   2 We previously entered into a lease agreement for 186,000 square feet of rentable space located in an office facility in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, which serves as our headquarters. The term of the lease is 183 months, beginning on October 1, 2014 and expiring on December 31, 2029. We have a one-time right to terminate the lease on December 31, 2025 by providing the landlord with at least 18 months' prior written notice of such termination.   3 Other operating leases primarily include noncancellable lease commitments for our other domestic and international offices as well as certain operating equipment.   4 Unconditional purchase obligations primarily include royalties and software licenses and services, which are unrecorded as of December 31, 2020.   5 We have  31.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, that have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with income tax accounting guidance for which we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled. As a result, such amounts are excluded from the table above.   6 Other long-term obligations primarily include third-party commissions and technical support of  42.3 million; post-employment benefits, including pension obligations, of  13.9 million for certain foreign locations; deferred employment taxes of  6.9 million; and office space restoration of  3.4 million. These amounts include the related current portions when applicable.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Revenue Recognition  Our revenue is derived principally from the licensing of computer software products and from related maintenance contracts. We enter into contracts that include combinations of products, maintenance and services, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns.  Revenue from perpetual licenses is classified as software license revenue. Software license revenue is recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed product and or the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that an enforceable contract has been received. Typically, our perpetual licenses are sold with post-contract support  PCS , which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. We allocate value in bundled perpetual and PCS arrangements based on the standalone selling prices of the perpetual license and PCS. Revenue from PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as we satisfy the PCS performance obligation over time.  In addition to perpetual licenses, we sell time-based lease licenses. Lease licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term software license and PCS. Utilizing observable inputs, we determined that 50  of the estimated standalone selling price of the lease license is attributable to the term license and 50  is attributable to the PCS. This determination considered the value relationship for our products between PCS and time-based lease licenses, the value relationship between PCS and perpetual licenses, the average economic life of our products, software renewal rates and the price of the bundled arrangement in relation to the perpetual licensing approach. Consistent with the perpetual sales, the license component is classified as software license revenue and recognized as revenue up front at the commencement of the lease upon delivery of the licensed product and or utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys. The PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, as we satisfy the PCS performance obligation over time.  Revenue from training, support and other services is recognized as the services are performed. For contracts in which the service consists of a single performance obligation, such as providing a training class to a customer, we recognize revenue upon completion of the performance obligation. For service contracts that are longer in duration and often include multiple performance obligations  for example, both training and consulting , we measure the progress toward completion of the obligations and recognize revenue accordingly. In measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligations, we typically utilize output-based estimates for services with contractual billing arrangements that are not based on time and materials, and estimate output based on the total tasks completed as compared to the total tasks required for each work contract. Input-based estimates are utilized for services that involve general consultations with contractual billing arrangements based on time and materials, utilizing direct labor as the input measure. Proceeds from customers for the purpose of expediting roadmap items, developing new products or creating specific features and functionality for existing products are classified as revenue.  We also execute arrangements through independent channel partners in which the channel partners are authorized to market and distribute our software products to end users of our products and services in specified territories. In sales facilitated by channel partners, the channel partner bears the risk of collection from the end-user customer. We recognize revenue from transactions with channel partners in a manner consistent with the direct sales described above for both perpetual and time-based licenses. Revenue from channel partner transactions is the amount remitted to us by the channel partners. This amount includes a fee for PCS that is compensation for providing technical enhancements and the second level of technical support to the end user, which is recognized over the period that PCS is to be provided.  Non-income related taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and accrued expenses. The collection and payment of these amounts are reported on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income and do not impact reported revenues or expenses.  We do not offer right of return. We warrant to our customers that our software will perform substantially as specified in our current user manuals. We have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support, which we are already obligated to provide. The warranty is not sold, and cannot be purchased, separately. The warranty does not provide any type of additional service to the customer or performance obligation for us.  Our agreements with our customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third-party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. Such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including our right to replace an infringing product.  Significant Judgments  Our contracts with customers typically include promises to transfer licenses and services to a customer. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, to allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation. We use the estimated standalone selling price method to allocate the transaction price for each performance obligation. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including market conditions and other observable inputs. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.  We apply a practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. Sales commissions associated with the initial year of multi-year contracts are expensed as incurred due to their immateriality. Sales commissions associated with multi-year contracts beyond the initial year are subject to an employee service requirement and are expensed as incurred as they are not considered incremental costs to obtain a contract.  We are required to adjust promised amounts of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of the payments provides the customer or us with a significant financing benefit. We consider various factors in assessing whether a financing component exists, including the duration of the contract, market interest rates and the timing of payments. Our contracts do not include a significant financing component requiring adjustment to the transaction price.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually by performing a quantitative assessment of whether the fair value of each reporting unit or asset exceeds its carrying amount. We have one reporting unit. Goodwill is tested at this reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested at the individual asset level. This requires us to assess and make judgments regarding a variety of factors which impact the fair value of the reporting unit or asset being tested, including business plans, anticipated future cash flows, economic projections and other market data. Because there are inherent uncertainties involved in these factors, significant differences between these estimates and actual results could result in future impairment charges and could materially impact our future financial results.  During the first quarter of 2020, we completed the annual impairment test for goodwill and the indefinite-lived intangible asset and determined that these assets had not been impaired as of the test date, January 1, 2020. Given the adverse economic and market conditions caused by COVID-19, we considered a variety of qualitative factors to determine if an additional quantitative impairment test was required subsequent to our annual impairment test. Based on a variety of factors, including the excess of the fair values over the carrying amounts in the most recent impairment test, we determined it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed as of March 31, 2020. No other events or circumstances changed during the year ended December 31, 2020 that would indicate that the fair values of our reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset are below their carrying amounts.  Intangible assets are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. We determined the fair value of our intangible assets using various valuation techniques, including the relief-from-royalty method and the multi-period excess earnings method. These models utilize certain unobservable inputs classified as Level 3 measurements as defined by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and is sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating fair value requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry and economic conditions. These assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to  royalty rate, discount rate and attrition rate. The fair values of the intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets are both not recoverable and exceed the fair values.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.  We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance was used to reduce their carrying value, the adjustment to the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes.  Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more-likely-than-not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open.  We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes within the income tax expense line in the consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.  Stock-Based Compensation  We grant restricted stock units and other stock awards to employees and directors under our equity incentive plan. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under our employee stock purchase plan. The benefits provided under these plans are stock-based payments subject to the provisions of stock-based payment accounting guidance. We use the fair value method to apply the provisions of stock-based payment accounting guidance. Stock-based compensation expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was  145.6 million,  116.2 million and  83.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to awards granted prior to that date was  160.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.  Prior to 2017, we granted stock option awards. The value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant, or date of acquisition for options issued in a business combination, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model  Black-Scholes model . The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards using an option pricing model was affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables included our stock volatility during the preceding six years, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, interest rate assumptions using the five-year U.S. Treasury Note yield on the date of grant or acquisition date, and expected dividends. The stock-based compensation expense for options was recorded ratably over the requisite service period. As of December 31, 2020, all stock options are fully vested and all expense has been recognized accordingly.  We issue various restricted stock unit awards which contain either a market condition, a performance condition, a service condition, or certain combinations of the three. Restricted stock unit awards are valued based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the employee's requisite service period for awards with only a service condition.  Awards with performance conditions are granted over three one-year sub-performance periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized from the grant date through the end of the three-year performance period contingent upon continued employment and management's estimates concerning the probability of vesting.  At times, the Compensation Committee may grant long-term performance awards. Stock based compensation expense for these awards is recognized over the performance period from the grant date through the end of the performance period contingent upon continued employment and management's estimates concerning the probability of vesting.  Vesting of restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is based on our performance as measured by total stockholder return relative to the appreciation of a specified stock index over the measurement period, subject to each participant's continued employment through the conclusion of the measurement period. The fair value of the restricted stock unit awards with a market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of the fair value of the awards is affected by the grant date and several variables, each of which has been identified in the chart below. Stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award is recorded from the grant date through the conclusion of the measurement period.  Year Ended December 31,  Assumptions used in Monte Carlo lattice pricing model 2020 2019 2018  Risk-free interest rate 0.7  2.5  2.4   Expected dividend yield -  -  -   Expected volatility-Ansys stock price 25  23  21   Expected volatility-Nasdaq Composite Index 18  16  15   Expected term 2.8 years 2.8 years 2.8 years  Correlation factor 0.77 0.71 0.65  Weighted average fair value per share  245.08  238.99  191.76  We also grant restricted stock units to non-employee Directors, which vest upon the earlier of one year from the date of grant or the date of the next regular annual meeting of stockholders. If a non-employee Director retires prior to the vest date, the non-employee Director receives a pro-rata portion of the restricted stock units.  To the extent we change the terms of our stock-based compensation programs, experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility assumption used in the pricing models, refine different assumptions, or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements, among other potential impacts, the stock-based compensation expense recorded in future periods and the related tax benefits may differ significantly from what was recorded in previous reporting periods. Forfeitures of awards are accounted for as they occur.  Estimates of stock-based compensation expense are significant to our financial statements, but this expense is partially based on the aforementioned option valuation and Monte Carlo simulation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us other than through the payment of withholding taxes in lieu of additional share issuance. For this reason, and because we do not view stock-based compensation as related to our operational performance, the Board of Directors and management exclude stock-based compensation expense when evaluating our underlying business performance.  Contingencies  We are involved in various investigations, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights and other matters. We review the status of these matters, assess our financial exposure and record a related accrual if the potential loss from an investigation, claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of probability and in the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. As a result of the uncertainties involved in making these estimates, we may have to revise our estimates as facts and circumstances change. The revision of these estimates could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently expect to be immaterial may also affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  If we fail to manage our transition to a more subscription-based business model successfully, our results of operations and or cash flows could be negatively impacted.  We are transitioning to a more subscription-based business model, which may have negative revenue and or cash flow implications. The subscription model prices and delivers our software differently than a perpetual license model. These changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales in favor of providing our clients the right to access our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. The potential shift of our clients preference to a cloud-based subscription model requires a considerable investment of technical, financial, legal, managerial and sales resources, and a scalable organization.  Market acceptance of our subscription-based offering will depend on our ability to continue to   innovate and include new functionality and improve the usability of our products in a manner that addresses our clients needs and requirements; and  optimally price our products in light of marketplace conditions, competition, our costs, and client demand.  Our cloud-based subscription model also requires that we rely on third parties to host our products for our clients. We incur significant recurring third-party hosting expenses to deliver our Pega Cloud offering that we do not incur for our perpetual and term license products. These expenses may cause the gross margin we realize from our Pega Cloud sales to be lower than the gross margin we realize from our perpetual and term license products. If we are unable to meet these challenges effectively, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  The transition to a subscription-based business model gives rise to several risks, including the following   our revenues and cash flows may fluctuate more than anticipated in the near term;  if the increased demand for our offerings does not continue, we could experience decreased profitability or losses and reduced or negative cash flow because of our continued significant investments in our Pega Cloud offering;  if new or current clients desire only perpetual licenses, our subscription sales may lag behind our expectations;  we may be unsuccessful in maintaining or implementing our target pricing or new pricing models, product adoption and projected renewal rates, or we may select a target price or new pricing model that is not optimal and could negatively affect our sales or earnings;  if our clients do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue may decline, and our business may be materially adversely affected; and  we may incur sales compensation costs at a higher than forecasted rate if the pace of our subscription transition is faster than anticipated.  The metrics our investors and we use to monitor our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge. Therefore, it may be difficult to accurately determine the impact of this transition on our business on a contemporaneous basis or to clearly communicate the appropriate metrics to our investors.  We may not achieve the key elements of our strategy and grow our business as anticipated.  We currently intend to grow our business by pursuing strategic initiatives. Key elements of our strategy include growing our market share by developing and delivering robust applications that can work together seamlessly with maximum differentiation and minimal customization, offering versatility in our Pega Platform and application deployment and licensing options to meet the specific needs of our clients, growing our network of partner alliances, and developing the talent and organizational structure capable of supporting our revenue and earnings growth targets. We may not be able to achieve one or more of our key initiatives. Our success depends on our ability to manage our expenses as we grow our organization appropriately, successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies, successfully incorporate acquired technologies into our unified Pega Platform and develop new products or product enhancements. If we are not able to execute these actions, our business may not grow as we anticipate, and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We depend on key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, and must be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future.  Our business is dependent on key, highly skilled technical, managerial, consulting, sales, and marketing personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our founder and largest stockholder.  On February 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement with our landlord to vacate our Cambridge, Massachusetts facility on October 1, 2021 and expect to enter into a new lease agreement for a facility within the greater Boston area. Although we believe this relocation will help us attract and retain key personnel and provide a dynamic space to engage with our employees, competition for talent, delays in and costs associated with development and occupancy of the new facility and changes in commuting for our existing employees could impact our ability to realize the intended benefits of the move.  The loss of key personnel could be disruptive to our operations, and materially adversely affect financial performance. We do not have any significant key-person life insurance on any officers or employees and do not plan to obtain any. Our success will largely depend on the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and rapidly replace and develop new management. The number of potential employees who have the extensive knowledge needed to develop, sell, and maintain our offerings is limited, and competition for their services is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. If we are unable to do so, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  The timing of our license and Pega Cloud revenue is difficult to predict accurately, which may cause our operating results to vary considerably.  A change in the size or volume of license and Pega Cloud arrangements, or a change in the mix between perpetual licenses, term licenses, and Pega Cloud arrangements can cause our revenues and cash flows to fluctuate materially between periods. Revenue from Pega Cloud arrangements is typically recognized over the contract term. In contrast, revenue from license sales is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective. Pega Cloud and term license arrangements are generally billed and collected over the contract term while perpetual license arrangements are generally billed in full and collected upfront when the license rights become effective.  Factors that may influence the predictability of our license and Pega Cloud revenue include   changes in clients budgets and decision-making processes that could affect both the timing and size of transactions;  deferral of license revenue to future periods due to the timing of the execution of an agreement or our ability to deliver the products or services;  changes in our business model; and  our ability to execute our marketing and sales strategies.  We budget for our selling and marketing, product development, and other expenses based upon anticipated future bookings and revenue. If the timing or amount of revenue fails to meet our expectations in a given period, our financial performance is likely to be materially adversely affected because only a small portion of our expenses vary with revenue. Other factors that may cause our operating results to vary considerably include changes in foreign currency exchange rates, income tax effects, and the impact of new accounting pronouncements.  As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon to predict future performance. If our revenues and operating results do not meet the expectations of our investors or securities analysts or fall below guidance we may provide to the market, or due to other factors discussed elsewhere in this section, the price of our common stock may decline.  The number of license and Pega Cloud arrangements has been increasing, and we may not be able to sustain this growth unless our partners and we can provide sufficient high-quality consulting, training, and maintenance resources to enable our clients to realize significant business value from our software.  Our clients typically request consulting and training to assist them in implementing our license and Pega Cloud offerings. Our clients also typically purchase maintenance on our perpetual and term licenses. As a result, an increase in the number of license and Pega Cloud arrangements is likely to increase demand for consulting, training, and maintenance related to our offerings. Given that the number of our license and Pega Cloud arrangements has been growing, we will need to provide our clients with more consulting, training, and maintenance to enable them to realize significant business value from our software. We have been increasing our partner and client enablement through training to create an expanded ecosystem of people that are skilled in the implementation of our products. However, if our partners and we are unable to provide sufficient high-quality consulting, training, and maintenance resources, our clients may not realize sufficient business value from our offerings to justify follow-on sales, which could impact our future financial performance. Further, some of our client engagements have high public visibility. If our partners or we encounter problems in helping these clients implement our license and Pega Cloud offerings or if there is negative publicity regarding these engagements  even if unrelated to our services or offerings  our reputation could be harmed and our future financial performance could be negatively impacted. Finally, the investments required to meet the increased demand for our consulting services could strain our ability to deliver our consulting engagements at desired profitability, thereby impacting our overall profitability and financial results.  We may not be able to maintain our retention rate for Pega Cloud clients.  An increasing percentage of our revenue has been derived from our Pega Cloud offerings. Our clients have no obligation to renew their Pega Cloud subscriptions, although historically, most have elected to do so. If our retention rate for those clients decreases our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We are investing heavily in sales and marketing, research and development, and support resources in anticipation of continued growth in license and Pega Cloud arrangements, and we may experience decreased profitability or losses and reduced or negative cash flow if we do not continue to increase the value of our license and Pega Cloud arrangements to balance our growth in expenses.  We have been expanding our sales and marketing capacity to meet the increasing demand for our software and to broaden our market coverage by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel. We anticipate that we will need to provide our clients with more maintenance support because of this increase in demand and have been hiring additional personnel in this area. We continue to invest significantly in research and development to expand and improve the Pega Platform and applications. These investments have resulted in increased fixed costs that do not vary with the level of revenue. If the increased demand for our offerings does not continue, we could experience decreased profitability or losses and reduced or negative cash flow because of these increased fixed costs. Conversely, if we are unable to hire sales and marketing personnel to meet future demand or research and development personnel to enhance our current products or develop new products, we may not be able to achieve our sales and profitability targets.  We face risks from operations and clients based outside of the U.S.  We market our products and services to clients based outside of the U.S., which represent 43  of our revenue over the last three years. We have established offices in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia. We believe that growth will necessitate expanded international operations, resulting in increased managerial attention and costs. We anticipate hiring additional personnel to accommodate increased international market demand, and we may also enter into agreements with local distributors, representatives, or resellers. If we are unable to do one or more of these things in a timely and effective manner, the growth, if any, of our international operations may be restricted, and our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Additional risks inherent in our international business activities generally include   laws and business practices favoring local competitors;  compliance with multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data privacy and protection, and increased tariffs and other trade barriers;  the costs of localizing offerings for local markets, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;  longer payment cycles and credit and collectability risk on our foreign trade receivables;  difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;  heightened fraud and bribery risks;  treatment of revenue from international sources and changes to tax codes, including being subject to foreign tax laws, being liable for paying withholding, income or other taxes in foreign jurisdictions, and other potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of double taxation ;  management of our international operations, including increased accounting, internal control, and compliance expenses;  heightened risks of political and economic instability; and  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and controls.  There can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  We rely on third-party relationships.  We have a number of relationships with third parties that are significant to our sales, marketing, support, and product development efforts, including hosting facilities for our Pega Cloud offering. We rely on software and hardware vendors, large system integrators, and technology consulting firms to supply marketing and sales opportunities for our direct sales force and to strengthen our products using industry-standard tools and utilities. We also have relationships with third parties that distribute our products. There can be no assurance that these companies, many of which have far greater financial and marketing resources than us, will not develop or market offerings that compete with ours in the future or will not otherwise end or limit their relationships with us. Further, the use of third-party hosting facilities requires us to rely on the functionality and availability of the third parties services, as well as their data security, which despite our due diligence, may be or become inadequate.  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.  Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside of the U.S., we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies. The operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies, which partially offset our foreign currency exposure on our international sales. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and the Australian dollar relative to the British Pound. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve.  We have historically used but do not currently use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency-denominated cash, accounts receivable, and intercompany receivables and payables held by our U.S. parent company and its U.K. subsidiary. We may enter into hedging contracts again in the future if we believe it is appropriate.  Our realized gain or loss for foreign currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.  Our consulting revenue is significantly dependent upon our consulting personnel implementing new license and Pega Cloud arrangements.  We derive a substantial portion of our consulting revenue from implementations of new license and Pega Cloud arrangements managed by our consulting personnel and consulting for partner and client-led implementation efforts. Our strategy is to support and encourage partner-led and client-led implementations to increase the breadth, capability, and depth of market capacity to deliver implementation services to our clients. Accordingly, if our consulting personnels involvement in future implementations decreases, this could materially adversely affect our consulting revenue.  We frequently enter into a series of license or Pega Cloud arrangements that are each focused on a specific purpose or area of operations. If we are not successful in obtaining follow-on business from these clients, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.  Once a client has realized the value of our software, we work with the client to identify opportunities for follow-on sales. However, we may not be successful in demonstrating this value for several reasons, including the performance of our products, the quality of the services and support provided by our partners and us, or external factors. Also, some of our smaller clients may have limited additional sales opportunities available. We may not obtain follow-on sales, or the follow-on sales may be delayed, and our future revenue could be limited. This could lower the total value of all transactions, and materially adversely affect our financial performance.  We will need to acquire or develop new products, evolve existing ones, address any defects or errors, and adapt to technology changes.  Technical developments, client requirements, programming languages, industry standards, and regulatory requirements frequently change in the markets in which we operate. The introduction of third-party solutions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, our success will depend upon our ability to enhance current products, address any product defects or errors, acquire or develop and introduce new products that meet client needs, keep pace with technology and regulatory changes, respond to competitive products, and achieve market acceptance. Product development requires substantial investments for research, refinement, and testing. We may not have sufficient resources to make the necessary product development investments. We may experience technical or other difficulties that will delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, or implementation of new or enhanced products. We may also experience technical or other challenges in the integration of acquired technologies into our existing platform and applications. Inability to introduce or implement new or enhanced products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share if competitors are able to provide solutions to meet client needs before we do, give rise to unanticipated expenses related to further development or modification of acquired technologies, and materially adversely affect our financial performance. We may also fail to adequately anticipate and prepare for the development of new markets and applications for our technology and the commercialization of emerging technologies such as blockchain and thereby fail to take advantage of new market opportunities or fall behind early movers in those markets.  The market for our offerings is intensely and increasingly competitive, rapidly changing, and fragmented.  We encounter significant competition from   customer engagement vendors, including CRM application vendors;  DPA vendors and platforms, including BPM vendors, low code application development platforms, and service-oriented architecture middleware vendors;  case management vendors;  decision management, data science, and AI vendors, as well as vendors of solutions that leverage decision making and data science in managing customer relationships and marketing;  robotic automation and workforce intelligence software providers;  companies that provide application-specific software for financial services, healthcare, insurance, and other specific markets;  mobile application platform vendors;  co-browsing software providers;  social listening, text analytics, and natural language processing vendors;  commercialized open-source vendors;  professional service organizations that develop their own products or create custom software in conjunction with rendering consulting services; and  clients in-house information technology departments, which may seek to modify their existing systems or develop their own proprietary systems.  Many of our competitors, such as Salesforce.com, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE, ServiceNow, and International Business Machines Corporation  IBM , have far greater resources than we do and may be able to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies, programming languages or standards, or changes in client requirements or preferences. Competitors may also be able to devote greater managerial and financial resources to develop, promote, and distribute products and to provide related consulting and training services.  We believe the principal competitive factors within our market include   product adaptability, scalability, functionality, and performance;  proven success in delivering cost-savings and efficiency improvements;  proven success in enabling improved customer interactions;  ease-of-use for developers, business units, and end-users;  timely development and introduction of new products and product enhancements;  establishment of a significant base of reference clients;  ability to integrate with other products and technologies;  customer service and support;  product price;  vendor reputation; and  relationships with systems integrators.  Competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions is likely to increase. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  See  Competition  in Item 1 of this Annual Report for additional information.  Our Chief Executive Officer is our largest stockholder and can exert significant influence over matters submitted to our stockholders, which could materially adversely affect our other stockholders.  As of December 31, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer beneficially owned 49  of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he has the ability to exert significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us, discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, or result in actions that may be opposed by other stockholders.  Risks Related to Information Technology Resilience and Security  We face risks related to outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure.  The increasing user traffic for our Pega Cloud offering demands more computing power. It requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of client data, power outages, or telecommunications infrastructure outages, by our third-party service providers or us, could diminish the quality of our user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by clients and other third parties, damage to our reputation, loss of current and potential clients, and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.  Security of our systems and global client data is a growing challenge on many fronts. Cyber-attacks and security breaches may expose us to significant legal and financial liabilities.  Security breaches could expose our clients and us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability, and negatively impact our future sales. High-profile security breaches at other companies have increased in recent years. Security industry experts and government officials have warned about the risks of hackers and cyber-attackers targeting information technology products and businesses. Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual hackers, groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations, or nation-states themselves, may take steps that threaten our clients and IT structure. Additionally, our Pega Cloud offering provides environments that are provisioned, monitored, and maintained for individual clients to create and deploy Pega-based applications using an Internet-based infrastructure. These services involve the storage and transmission of clients data and other confidential information.  Our security measures and those of our clients may be breached because of third-party actions or that of employees, consultants, or others, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, system error, human error, technical flaws in our products, or otherwise. Because we do not control the configuration of Pega applications by our clients, the transmissions between our clients and our third-party technology providers, the processing of data on the servers at third-party technology providers, or the internal controls maintained by our clients and third-party technology providers that could prevent unauthorized access or provide appropriate data encryption, we cannot fully ensure the complete integrity or security of such transmissions processing or controls. In addition, privacy, security, and data transmission concerns in some parts of the world may inhibit demand for our Pega Cloud offering or lead to requirements to provide our products or services in configurations that may increase the cost of serving such markets. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and are generally not recognized until launched against a target. While we have invested in protecting our data and systems and our clients data to reduce these risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breaches. We carry data breach insurance coverage to mitigate the financial impact of a breach, though this may prove insufficient in the event of a breach.  Our Pega Cloud offering involves the hosting of clients applications on the servers of third-party technology providers. We also rely on third-party systems and technology, including encryption, virtualized infrastructure, and support, and we employ a shared security model with our clients and our third-party technology providers.  To defend against security threats, we need to continuously engineer products and services with enhanced security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities, apply technologies that mitigate the risk of attacks, and maintain a digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services. The cost of these steps could negatively impact our operating results.  We may experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services and could face privacy, product liability, and warranty claims as a result.  Despite quality testing each release, our software frequently contains errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Errors in our software could affect its ability to work with hardware or other software or delay the development or release of new products or new versions of our software. Additionally, the detection and correction of any security flaws can be time-consuming and costly. Errors or security flaws in our software could result in the inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or personal data relating to our clients, employees, or third parties. Software errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to privacy, product liability, and or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation, which could impact our future sales of products and services. Typically, we enter into license agreements that contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of product liability and warranty claims. There is a risk that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable. Also, there is a risk that these contract terms might not bind a party other than the direct client. Furthermore, some of our licenses with our clients are governed by non-U.S. law, and there is a risk that foreign law might give us less or different protection. Although we have not experienced any material product liability claims to date, a product liability suit or action claiming a breach of warranty, whether meritorious, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and our resources.  Risks Related to Our Financial Obligations and Indebtedness  We have a significant amount of debt that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.  As of December 31, 2020, we had  600 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025  the Notes .  Our indebtedness may   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other business purposes;  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general business purposes;  require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;  limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors;  dilute the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon the conversion of the Notes; and  increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.  Our ability to pay our debt when due or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary investments in our business. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full which could harm our financial condition, results of operation or cost of borrowing. In addition, we may incur additional debt to meet future financing needs. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness will increase.  The conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  Under certain circumstances, the noteholders may convert their Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities. Upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion, we will be obligated to make cash payments. In addition, holders of our Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture, dated as of February 24, 2020, between U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee  the Trustee  and us  the Indenture  , at a repurchase price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. Although it is our intention and we currently expect to settle the conversion value of the Notes in cash up to the principal amount and any excess in shares, there is a risk that we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes when the Indenture requires the repurchase or to pay any cash payable on the Notes future conversions as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof. In addition, even if holders of Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  The Capped Call Transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.  In connection with the Notes issuance, we entered into Capped Call Transactions with certain financial institutions  option counterparties . The Capped Call Transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes and or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the option counterparties that are parties to the Capped Call Transactions or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions before the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock.  We are exposed to counterparty risk for the Capped Call Transactions.  The option counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the Capped Call Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. Recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure depends on many factors, but our exposure will generally increase if the market price or the volatility of our common stock increases. In addition, upon default or other failures to perform, or termination of obligations, by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.  Provisions in the Notes Indenture may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our stockholders.  If a fundamental change occurs prior to the Notes maturity date, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change  as defined in the Indenture  occurs prior to the maturity date, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate of the Notes for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.  Furthermore, the Indenture will prohibit us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions in the Indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to our stockholders.  Conversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders.  The conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect our common stocks prevailing market prices. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.  We are required to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our revolving credit facility. Failure to comply with these covenants could cause amounts borrowed to become immediately due and payable and or prevent us from borrowing under the credit facility.  We must comply with specified financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make payments, limiting our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any debt payment obligations could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and or unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. We might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations. In addition, if we are not in compliance with the financial and operating covenants under the credit facility at the time we wish to borrow funds, we will be unable to borrow funds. The financial and operating covenants under the credit facility may limit our ability to borrow funds or capital, including for strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes.  Risks Related to Government Regulation and Intellectual Property  Our success depends in part on maintaining and increasing our sales to clients in the public sector.  We derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with federal, state, local, and foreign governments and agencies. We believe that our businesss success and growth will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales.  Factors that could impede our ability to maintain or increase the revenue derived from government contracts include   changes in fiscal or contracting policies;  decreases in available government funding;  changes in government programs or applicable requirements;  the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;  potential delays or changes in the government appropriations or other funding authorization processes;  governments and governmental agencies requiring contractual terms that are unfavorable to us, such as most-favored-nation pricing provisions; and  delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices.  The occurrence of any of those factors could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our software in the future or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  Further, to increase our sales to clients in the public sector, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, performance, and pricing of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal, state, and local governmental bodies, which affect how our channel partners and we do business in connection with governmental agencies. These laws and regulations may impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations or other applicable requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners or government clients, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of intellectual property rights and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions, or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  We are subject to increasingly complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, requiring costly compliance measures. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, data privacy and security laws, and similar laws and regulations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar foreign anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to obtain or retain business. Similar laws and regulations exist in many other countries throughout the world in which we do or intend to do business. Data privacy laws and regulations in Europe, Australia, Latin America, and elsewhere are undergoing a rapid transformation toward increased restrictions.  In April 2016, the European Parliament adopted the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR . It became effective in May 2018. The GDPR extends the scope of European privacy laws to any entity that controls or processes EU residents' personal data in connection with the offer of goods or services or the monitoring of behavior and imposes new compliance obligations concerning the handling of personal data. Complying with the GDPR and other emerging and changing requirements caused us to incur additional costs in 2020 and may cause us to incur substantial additional costs or require us to change our business practices. Compliance also depends on how regulators choose to interpret and apply the new requirements. Moreover, non-compliance, or if regulators assert we have not complied, with GDPR could result in significant monetary penalties of up to the higher of 20 million Euro or 4  of annual worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.  The California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA , which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers  as defined in the law  and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households, went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California Attorney General may now bring enforcement actions for violations. The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provide consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.  We have developed and implemented a compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices, including the background checking of our current partners and prospective clients and partners. We cannot guarantee, however, that we, our employees, our consultants, our partners, or our contractors are or will be compliant with all federal, state, and foreign regulations, particularly as we expand our operations outside of the U.S. If our representatives or we fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of fines, penalties, and or other sanctions could be imposed on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we are determined not to have violated these laws, government inquiries into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also harm our business. In addition, regulation of data privacy and security laws is increasing worldwide, including various restrictions on cross-border access or transfer of data, including personal data of our employees, our clients, and customers of our clients. Compliance with such regulations may increase our costs, and there is a risk of enforcement of such laws resulting in damage to our brand, as well as financial penalties and potential loss of business, which could be significant.  We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.  The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities, and we are currently undergoing several inquiries, audits, and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could harm our business, and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.  In addition, our future income taxes could be materially adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional income mix, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as by certain discrete items.  In light of continuing fiscal challenges in many jurisdictions, various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including corporate income taxes. Several U.S. states have attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state, and taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions may take similar actions. Many U.S. states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to their state from certain out-of-state businesses. Similarly, in Europe and elsewhere globally, there are various tax reform efforts underway designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings.  If it becomes necessary or desirable to repatriate any of our foreign cash balances to the United States, we may be subject to increased taxes, other restrictions, and limitations.  As of December 31, 2020,  66.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents were held in our foreign subsidiaries. If it becomes necessary or desirable to repatriate these funds, we may be required to pay U.S. federal, state, and local income and foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation. We consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. As a result, U.S. federal, state, and local, and foreign withholding taxes on such earnings have not been provided in our financial statements. It is not practical to estimate the amount of tax we would have to pay upon repatriation due to the complexity of the tax laws and other factors.  We face risks related to intellectual property claims or appropriation of our intellectual property rights.  We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets laws, as well as intellectual property and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies and other proprietary information. We have obtained patents in strategically important global markets relating to the architecture of our systems. We cannot assure that such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that rights granted thereunder, or the claims contained therein will provide us with competitive advantages. Moreover, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our software or to obtain the use of information that we regard as proprietary. Although we generally enter into intellectual property and confidentiality agreements with our employees and strategic partners, despite our efforts our former employees may seek employment with our business partners, clients, or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as they do in the U.S. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology.  Other companies or individuals have obtained proprietary rights covering a variety of designs, processes, and systems. There can be no assurance that third parties, including clients, will not claim infringement by us for current or future products. Although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for infringement of the proprietary rights of third parties and assert ownership of work product and intellectual property rights as appropriate, there are often exceptions, and limitations may not be applicable and enforceable in all cases. Even if limitations are found to be applicable and enforceable, our liability to our clients for these types of claims could be material given the size of certain of our transactions. We expect that software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment and delivery delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or be precluded from making and selling the infringing software, if such proprietary rights are found to be valid. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require substantial effort and cost. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our software and may be unable to compete effectively, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results, and financial condition.  We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.  Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies can dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. The litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenues and against which our patents may, therefore, provide little or no deterrence. We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties' intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.  Coronavirus  COVID-19   Epidemic diseases, such as the recent global COVID-19 outbreak, could harm our business and results of operations.  The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease  COVID-19 , which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A pandemic, including COVID-19, or other public health epidemics pose the risk that our employees, partners, and clients may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period, including due to the spread of the disease within these groups or due to the shutdowns that are requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of IT spending and may adversely affect our clients willingness to purchase our solutions, delay prospective clients purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their contracts, request concessions including extended payment terms or better pricing, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.  We have undertaken measures to protect our employees, partners, and clients, including by adopting a virtual-only meeting format for our annual PegaWorld conference and encouraging employees to work remotely. There can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient, however, or that we can implement them without adversely affecting our business operations.  We continue to monitor the situation and adjust our policies as more information and public health guidance become available. Precautionary measures that have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, could negatively affect our client success efforts, sales, and marketing efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, COVID-19 may disrupt our clients, vendors, and partners operations for an indefinite period, including as a result of travel restrictions and or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations, including cash flows.  At this time, it is not possible to estimate the ultimate impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Furthermore, due to our shift to a renewable model, the effect of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to predict accurately, including   the duration and scope of the pandemic;  governmental, business, and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic and the impact of those actions on global economic activity;  the actions that are taken in response to economic disruption;  the impact of business disruptions and reductions in our clients business and the resulting impact on their demand for our services and solutions; and  our ability to provide our services and solutions, including as a result of our employees or our clients employees working remotely and or closures of offices and facilities.  General Risk Factors  The provision in our amended and restated bylaws, requiring exclusive forum in certain courts in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts for certain types of lawsuits, may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees.  Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Business Litigation Section of the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts  the BLS  or, if the BLS lacks jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts, Eastern Division, shall be the exclusive forum for any  i  derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf,  ii  any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders,  iii  any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act  the MBCA , our articles of organization, or our bylaws  as each may be amended from time to time , or  iv  any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  The choice of forum provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims, or limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us or our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  The continued uncertainties in the global economy may negatively impact our sales to, and the collection of receivables, from our clients.  Our sales to, and the collection of receivables from, our clients may be impacted by adverse changes in global economic conditions. The U.S. and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time, during which economic activity has been impacted by falling demand for goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity, and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, and economic uncertainty. These changes in global economic conditions could impact the ability and willingness of our clients to make investments in technology, which in turn may delay or reduce the purchases of our software and services. These factors could also impact the ability and willingness of these clients to pay their trade obligations and honor their contractual commitments. These clients may also become subject to increasingly restrictive regulatory requirements, which could limit or delay their ability to proceed with technology purchases and may result in longer sales cycles, increased price competition, and reductions in sales of our products and services. The financial uncertainties facing many of our clients and the industries in which they operate could negatively impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.  The U.K.s withdrawal from the European Union  commonly referred to as Brexit  on January 31, 2020 could have a material impact on our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers, and employees, which could harm our financial results and operations.  We have material operations in the U.K. and European Union. The ultimate or perceived effects of the U.K.s withdrawal from the European Union, could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile.  The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, some of which are related in complex ways.  Factors that may affect the market price of our common stock include   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;  variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;  changes in our projected operating and financial results;  changes in the prices of our products and professional services;  changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or services;  announcements by our competitors or us of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new offerings;  our involvement in any litigation or investigations by regulators;  our sale of our common stock or other securities;  changes in our Board of Directors, senior management, or key personnel;  the trading volume of our common stock;  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;  changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and  general economic, regulatory, political, and market conditions.  Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, regulatory, political, and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention.  We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.  We have provided and may continue to give guidance on our business, future operating results, and other business metrics. In developing this guidance, our management must make certain assumptions and judgments about our future performance. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of our business, which may form a consensus about our future performance. Our business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and which could materially adversely affect our operations and operating results. Furthermore, if we make downward revisions of our previously announced guidance, or if our publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors, or other interested parties, our common stock price would decline.  If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.  The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline."}

See risk factor  If we fail to manage our transition to a more subscription-based business model successfully, our results of operations and or cash flows could be negatively impacted.  in Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.  Coronavirus  COVID-19   As of December 31, 2020, COVID-19 has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  COVID-19's ultimate impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact of COVID-19 on our sales cycles, partners, vendors, and employees, all of which is uncertain and unpredictable. Our shift towards subscription-based revenue streams, the industry mix of our clients, the substantial size and available resources of our clients, and the critical nature of our products to our clients may reduce or delay the impact of COVID-19 on our business. However, it is not possible to estimate the ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on our business at this time.  See Coronavirus  COVID-19  in Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.  Relocation of Corporate Headquarters  On February 12, 2021, we entered into an agreement with our landlord to vacate our Cambridge, Massachusetts corporate headquarters on October 1, 2021, in exchange for a one-time payment to us of  18 million. We expect to enter into a new lease agreement for a facility within the greater Boston area.  Performance metrics  We utilize several performance metrics to analyze and assess our overall performance, make operating decisions, and forecast and plan for future periods, including   Annual contract value  ACV    Increased 21  since December 31, 2019  ACV, as reported, represents the annualized value of our active contracts as of the measurement date. The contract's total value is divided by its duration in years to calculate ACV for term license and Pega Cloud contracts. Maintenance revenue for the quarter then ended is multiplied by four to calculate ACV for maintenance. Client Cloud ACV is composed of maintenance ACV and ACV from term license contracts. ACV is a performance measure that we believe provides useful information to our management and investors, particularly during our Cloud Transition. Reported amounts have not been adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency contributed 1 -2  to ACV growth in 2020.  Remaining performance obligations  Backlog    Increased 28  since December 31, 2019  Backlog represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes deferred revenue and non-cancellable amounts expected to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods.    Pega Cloud revenue   Increased 56  since 2019  Pega Cloud revenue is revenue as reported under U.S. GAAP for cloud contracts.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Revenue  Cloud Transition  We are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. Revenue growth has and is expected to continue to be slower during this transition Revenue from Pega Cloud arrangements is typically recognized over the contract term. In contrast, revenue from license sales is generally recognized upfront when the license rights become effective.

The change in total revenue since 2019 generally reflects the impact of our Cloud Transition. Additional contributing factors were   An increasing portion of our term license contracts include multi-year committed maintenance periods instead of annually renewable maintenance periods. Under such arrangements, a larger portion of the total contract value is recognized as maintenance revenue over the contract term rather than as term license revenue upon effectiveness of the license rights. In 2020, multi-year committed maintenance contributed  10.2 million to maintenance revenue growth and reduced term revenue growth by  20.8 million.  Maintenance renewal rates remained over 90  in 2020.  The slight increase in consulting revenue in 2020 was primarily due to increased billable hours, which offset the impact of reduced billable travel expenses due to COVID-19. As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to continue growing and increasingly leveraging our ecosystem of partners on future implementation projects, potentially reducing our future consulting revenue growth rate.

The increase in consulting gross profit in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and an increase in consultant utilization. Consultant utilization is impacted by several factors, including the timing of new implementation projects and our scope and level of involvement in these projects compared to that of our consulting partners and enabled clients.

The increase in headcount reflects our efforts to increase our sales capacity to deepen relationships with existing clients and target new accounts.  The increase in research and development in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of  30.2 million, attributable to increases in headcount and equity compensation. The increase in headcount reflects additional investments in the development of our products, particularly for Pega Cloud.  The increase in general and administrative in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of  4.0 million, attributable to increases in headcount and equity compensation to support the growth in our operations and an increase in professional services fees of  4.2 million.

The decrease in interest income in 2020 was due to the significant decline in market interest rates despite the significant increase in our interest-bearing investment balances.  The increase in interest expense in 2020 was due to our issuance of  600 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes on February 24, 2020. See  Note 10.

See  Note 16. Income Taxes  in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.  Stock-based compensation increases the variability of our effective tax rates. The impact of stock-based compensation on a given period depends on our profitability, the attributes of our stock compensation awards we grant, and award holders' exercise behavior.

Whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, and the investments required to respond to the possible increased demand for our services. If we require additional capital resources to grow our business, we may seek to finance our operations from available funds or additional external financing.  If it became necessary to repatriate foreign funds, we may be required to pay U.S. and foreign taxes upon repatriation. Due to the complexity of income tax laws and regulations, and the Tax Reform Acts effects, it is impracticable to estimate the amount of taxes we would have to pay. See risk factor  If it becomes necessary or desirable to repatriate any of our foreign cash balances to the United States, we may be subject to increased taxes, other restrictions, and limitations  in Item 1A of this Annual Report for additional information.  Cash  used in  operating activities  We are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud. This transition has and is expected to continue to impact our billings and resulting timing of cash collections. Pega Cloud and term license arrangements are generally billed and collected over the contract term while perpetual license arrangements are generally billed in full and collected upfront when the license rights become effective. As client preferences continue to shift in favor of Pega Cloud arrangements, we could continue to experience slower operating cash flow growth, or negative cash flow, in the near term  In 2020, COVID-19 did not have a material impact on our cash flows from operations. See Coronavirus  COVID-19  in Item 1A. of this Annual Report for additional information.  The change in cash  used in  operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to improved cash collections. The increased cash collections were partially offset by increased costs as we accelerated investments in our Pega Cloud offering and selling and marketing activities to support future growth.  Cash  used in  provided by investing activities  The change in cash  used in  provided by investing activities in 2020 was primarily driven by purchases of financial instruments and property and equipment investments for our offices.

We may settle conversion by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of our common  stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. See  Note 10.

A detailed discussion and analysis of the 2019 year-over-year changes can be found in  Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS  Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and the rules and regulations of the SEC for annual financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and beliefs of what could occur in the future, given the available information.  We believe that, of our significant accounting policies, described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 of this Annual Report, the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and require the most subjective judgment. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements.  Revenue recognition  Our contracts with clients typically contain promises by us to provide multiple products and services. Specifically, contracts associated with Pega Platform sales and other software applications, sold either as licenses to use functional intellectual property or as a cloud-based solution, typically include consulting services. Determining whether such products and services within a client contract are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires significant judgment. We review client contracts to identify all separate promises to transfer goods and services that would be considered performance obligations. Judgment is also required in determining whether an option to acquire additional products and services within a client contract represents a material right that the client would not receive without entering into the contract.  A contract modification is a legally binding change to the scope, price, or both of an existing contract. Contract modifications are reviewed to determine whether they should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract. This determination requires significant judgment, which could impact the timing of revenue recognition. We typically account for contract modifications prospectively as a separate contract. The additional performance obligation s  in our contract modifications are generally distinct and priced at their stand-alone selling price.  We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations, including options in contracts determined to represent a material right, based on each performance obligation's relative stand-alone selling price. Judgment is required in estimating stand-alone selling prices. We maximize the use of observable inputs by maintaining pricing analyses that consider our pricing policies, historical stand-alone sales when they exist, and historical renewal prices charged to clients. We have concluded that the stand-alone selling prices of certain performance obligations, specifically the stand-alone selling prices of software licenses and Pega Cloud arrangements, are highly variable. In these instances, we estimate the stand-alone selling prices using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price minus the stand-alone selling price of other performance obligations promised in the contract. We update our stand-alone selling price analysis periodically, including a re-assessment of whether the residual approach used to determine the stand-alone selling prices for software licenses and Pega Cloud arrangements remains appropriate.  Changes in the assumptions or judgments used in determining the performance obligations in client contracts and stand-alone selling prices could significantly impact the timing and amount of revenue we report in a particular period.  Goodwill and intangible assets impairment  Our goodwill and intangible assets result from our previous business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate their value may no longer be recoverable. We do not carry any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of November 30th. To assess if goodwill is impaired, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. If based on the qualitative assessment, we consider it more-likely-than-not that our reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative impairment test. An excess of carrying value over fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We periodically reevaluate our business and have determined that we have one operating segment and one reporting unit. If our assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce our goodwill's carrying value. Changes in the valuation of goodwill could materially impact our operating results and financial position.  We evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets' carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating potential impairment of these assets, we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present, including, but not limited to   whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset;  whether there has been a significant change in the extent or way an asset is used; and  whether it is expected that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life.  If indicators of impairment are present, we compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate to its carrying value. The key assumptions of the cash flow model involve significant subjectivity. If such assets are impaired, an impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  As of December 31, 2020, we had  79.2 million of goodwill and  15.7 million of intangible assets. Changes in the valuation of long-lived assets could materially impact our operating results and financial position. To date, there have been no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets.  Accounting for income taxes  Significant judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in applying accounting principles and complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact our financial statements.  We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in our valuation allowance impact income tax expense in the period of adjustment. Our deferred tax valuation allowance requires significant judgment and uncertainties, including assumptions about future taxable income based on historical and projected information.  We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements.  As a global company, we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain. Some of these uncertainties arise due to transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries, the determination of tax nexus, and tax credit estimates. In addition, the calculation of acquired tax attributes and the associated limitations are complex. We estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability of such outcomes.  Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions, returns, and accruals. Such differences, or changes in estimates relating to potential differences, could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made.  See  Note 16. Income Taxes  in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.  Convertible senior notes and capped call transactions  In February 2020, we issued Convertible Senior Notes  the  Notes   with an aggregate principal amount of  600 million, due March 1, 2025, in a private placement. We also entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions  Capped Call Transactions  with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions cover 4.4 million shares  representing the number of shares for which the Notes are initially convertible  of our common stock and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution of our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes.  In accounting for the convertible senior notes and Capped Call Transactions   The initial carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring a similar debt instruments fair value that does not have an associated conversion feature. The excess of the Notes principal amount over the initial carrying amount of the liability component, the debt discount, is amortized as interest expense over the Notes contractual term. The fair value was determined utilizing a discounted cash flow model and required us to make various estimates including, implied credit spread, expected volatility, and the risk-free rate for notes with a similar term.  The equity component was recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital and is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Convertible Senior Notes.  The Capped Call Transactions are accounted for as derivative instruments. The Capped Call Transactions do not qualify for the Companys own equity scope exception in ASC 815 since, in some cases of early settlement, the settlement value of the Capped Call Transactions, calculated in accordance with the governing documents, may not represent a fair value measurement.  The fair value of the Capped Call Transactions at the end of each reporting period is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and, to a lesser extent, historical peer group volatility levels.  Applying the accounting framework for the Convertible Senior Notes and the Capped Call Transactions requires the exercise of judgment and the determination of the fair value of the liability component of the convertible notes and the fair value of the Capped Call Transactions requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. As of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10  increase in our stock price would have increased the fair value of the capped call to  96.5 million, while a hypothetical 10  decrease in our stock price would have decreased the fair value of the capped call to  70.3 million.

Worldwide Coronavirus Pandemic  COVID-19   On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus  COVID-19  a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts ordered all businesses and organizations that do not provide COVID-19 Essential Services to close their physical workplaces and facilities to workers, customers and the public as of noon on March 24, 2020. At that time, we took the necessary steps to enable an all-remote workforce. Many of our clients worldwide were similarly impacted. Over time, the restrictions in the state of Massachusetts were eased, or re-tightened, in line with the trends of the pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we were in a hybrid model with some employees coming into the office and others continuing to work remotely.  The global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to evolve, and the extent to which COVID-19 may have long-term impact on our business and the markets we serve, will depend on future developments-which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the pace of ongoing vaccination efforts in the United States and the rest of the world, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing measures in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.  We are continuing to monitor the situation with our primary focus on the health and safety of our employees and clients.

Going forward, we plan to transition Indigo into a wider SaaS offering.  Software products  We sell a broad range of software components, or building blocks, such as SDKs, APIs, and applications that customers use to streamline or develop their systems into more effective solutions. These building blocks enable important functions including   1.  Matching of biometric samples against biometric databases.  2.  Enrollment, analysis, and processing of biometric images and identity data on workstations.  3.  Image compression  BioComponents bundles our offerings as applications with a user interface. We also license our software unbundled as building blocks and have primarily sold these offerings as a perpetual license.  Building Blocks  SDKs, APIs, Applications, and Subsystems  Biometric Search   Matching SDKs  Our SDKs consist of  i  multiple software libraries; ii  sample applications that show customers how to use the libraries; and iii  documentation. Customers use our SDKs to design and develop biometrics applications. Nexa is our line of biometric search and match SDKs, including Nexa Fingerprint, Nexa Face, Nexa Iris and Nexa Voice. These products provide high-performance biometric algorithms for fingerprint, facial, iris and voice identification or authentication. The algorithms in these products convert images into biometric templates, which can then be compared to templates stored in databases to find matches.  In addition to the Nexa line, we also offer AwareXM, an interoperable fingerprint matching SDK that provides MINEX-certified, INCITS 378-compliant fingerprint minutiae extraction, template generation, and fingerprint authentication.  Biometric Enrollment SDKs and APIs  Our suite of enrollment SDKs and APIs performs functions that are critical to biometric enrollment, including  i  image capture and hardware abstraction,  ii  image quality assurance,  iii  image compression,  iv  mobile enrollment, matching and liveness verification, and  v  fingerprint card processing.  Imaging products  In addition to our biometrics software products, we also sell products used in applications involving medical and advanced imaging. Our principal imaging product is Aware JPEG 2000, which is based on the JPEG2000 standard. The JPEG2000 standard is an image compression standard and coding system that was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000. Our JPEG2000 product is used to compress, store, and display images. Those images are typically medical images.  Software maintenance  We also provide and sell software maintenance to many of our customers who purchase our software products and solutions. Software maintenance has historically been made available by contracts that typically have a one-year term during which customers have the right to receive technical support and software updates for a fixed fee, if and when they become available. Software maintenance is also available as part of a subscription-based solution offering under which customers receive standard software maintenance plus access to upgrades and product enhancements.  Services  We provide a variety of program management and software engineering services, including  i  project planning and management; ii  system and architecture design; iii  software design, development, customization, configuration, and testing; and iv  software integration and installation. Services are sold in conjunction with our products and solutions and are provided for a fixed fee or as part of a subscription-based fee.  Service engagement deliverables may include  i  complete customer software solutions; ii  one or more subsystems comprised of software products that are integrated within a larger system; iii  custom-configured versions of existing software products; or iv  custom-designed software products. In some cases, the software resulting from service engagements may form the basis for new or improved Aware software solutions and or products.  Our customers for services include  i  government agencies; ii  large multinational systems integrators; iii  smaller systems integrators with a particular market, technology or geographic focus; and iv  commercial partners or providers of products, solutions, and services for themselves or to their end customers. We provide services directly to end-users or indirectly to end-users through systems integrators or commercial entities or partners. When we provide services to systems integrators, they are often engaged with the end-user as a prime contractor and are responsible for delivery of a complete solution, in which case we typically serve as a subcontractor assigned a subset of the total scope of work.  The scope of our services projects varies. A small project might involve configuration and testing of a single software product, taking a small team one month or less. A large project might involve delivery of a more complex solution comprised of multiple products and subsystems, requiring a larger team to conduct program and project management, system design, software customization and integration, and taking up to one year or more. Some projects are followed by subsequent follow-on projects that serve to change or extend the features and functionality of the initial system.  Distribution Methods  We sell our products, solutions and services through three principal channels of distribution   i   Systems integrator channel - we sell to systems integrators that incorporate our software products and solutions into biometric systems that are delivered primarily to government end users.  ii   Direct channel - we sell directly to government, as well as commercial customers.  iii   OEM and VAR channel - we sell to hardware and software solution providers that incorporate our software products into their products for resale or use in their solution offerings or integrated software products.  Major Customers  All of our revenue in 2020 and 2019 was derived from unaffiliated customers. In 2019, one customer represented 16  of total revenue. No other customer represented 10  or more of total revenue in either 2020 or 2019.  Competitive Business Conditions  A significant number of established companies have developed or are developing and marketing software and hardware for biometrics products and applications that currently compete with or will compete directly with our offerings. We believe that additional competitors will enter the biometrics market and become significant long-term competitors, and that, as a result, competition will increase. Companies competing with us may introduce solutions that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances we have not yet developed or implemented. Our current principal competitors include     Diversified technology providers that offer integrated biometrics solutions to governments, law enforcement agencies and other organizations. This group of competitors includes companies such as Idemia, Thales, and NEC.    Component providers that offer biometrics software and hardware components for fingerprint, facial, iris and voice biometric identification. This group of competitors includes companies such as FaceTec, Dermalog, and Innovatrics.  We expect competition to intensify in the near term in the biometrics market. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and research resources than we have. Moreover, low-cost foreign competitors have demonstrated a willingness to sell their products at significantly reduced prices. To compete effectively in this environment, we must continually develop and market new and enhanced solutions and technologies at competitive prices and must have the resources available to invest in significant research and development activities. Our failure to compete successfully could cause our revenues and market share to decline.  Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights. We have an active program to protect our proprietary technology through the filing of patents. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 121 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 34 pending patent applications. Our patents and patent applications pertain primarily to biometrics and imaging compression.  Although we have patented certain aspects of our technology, we rely primarily on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures. Each of our employees is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.  Third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. We may receive claims from third parties suggesting that we may be obligated to license such intellectual property rights. If we were found to have infringed any third partys patents, we could be subject to substantial damages or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business.  Employees  As of December 31, 2020, we employed 90 people, including 52 in engineering and research, 25 in sales and marketing, and 13 in finance and administration. Of these employees, 77 were based in Massachusetts and 13 were based outside of Massachusetts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.  We believe that our future success will depend in large part on the service of our technical, sales, marketing and senior management personnel and upon our ability to retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our key managers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have been unable to   i  conduct face-to-face meetings with customers and prospective customers,  ii  present in-person demonstrations of our software solutions,  iii  attend trade shows and conferences which typically generate future sales opportunities or  iv  meet with prospective strategic partners. These effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our operating and financial results in 2020 and will likely have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results over the next several quarters.  The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.  Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period and are difficult to predict.  Individual orders can represent a meaningful percentage of our revenues and operating results in any single quarter and the timing of the receipt of those orders is difficult to predict. The failure to close an order or the deferral or cancellation of an order can result in revenue and net income shortfalls for that quarter. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed. As a result, we may not be able to sufficiently reduce our costs in any quarter to adequately compensate for an unexpected near-term shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter.  Our financial results may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the following     the lack or reduction of government funding and the political, budgetary and purchasing constraints of government customers who purchase products and services directly or indirectly from us;    the terms of customer contracts that affect the timing of revenue recognition;    the size and timing of our receipt of customer orders;    significant fluctuations in demand for our products and services;    the loss of a key customer or one of its key customers;    new competitors, or the introduction of enhanced solutions from new or existing competitors;    competitive pressures on selling prices;    cancellations, delays or contract amendments by government customers;    higher than expected costs, asset write-offs, and other one-time financial charges; and    general economic trends and other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a result of these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our revenue levels and operating results are not necessarily meaningful. You should not rely on our quarterly revenue and operating results to predict our future performance.  We derive a significant portion of our revenue directly or indirectly from government customers, and our business may be adversely affected by changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of those governmental entities.  We derive a significant portion of our revenue directly or indirectly from federal, international, state and local governments. We believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on government customers purchasing our products and services either directly through us or indirectly through our channel partners. Changes in government contracting policies or government budgetary constraints may adversely affect our financial performance. Among the factors that could adversely affect our business are     changes in fiscal policies or decreases in available government funding,    changes in government funding priorities;    changes in government programs or applicable requirements;    the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations;    changes in political or social attitudes with respect to security and defense issues;    changes in audit policies and procedures of government entities;    potential delays or changes in the government appropriations process; and    delays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices.  These and other factors could cause government customers or our channel partners to reduce purchases of products and services from us which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  A significant commercial market for biometrics technology may not develop, and, even if it does, there can be no assurance our biometrics technology will be successful.  A component of our strategy to grow revenue includes expansion into commercial markets. To date, biometrics technology has received only limited acceptance and slow adoption in such markets. Although the recent appearance of biometric readers on popular consumer products, such as smartphones, has increased interest in biometrics as a means of authenticating and or identifying individuals, commercial markets for biometrics technology are still in the process of developing and evolving. Biometrics-based solutions compete with more traditional security methods including keys, cards, personal identification numbers, passwords and security personnel. Acceptance of biometrics as an alternative to such traditional methods depends upon a number of factors including  i  the performance and reliability of biometric solutions; ii  costs involved in adopting and integrating biometric solutions; iii  public concerns regarding privacy; and iv  potential privacy legislation.  For these reasons, we are uncertain whether there will be significant demand for biometrics technology from commercial markets. Moreover, even if there is significant demand, there can be no assurance that our biometrics products will achieve market acceptance.  We derive a significant portion of our revenue from third party channel partners.  Our future results depend upon the continued successful distribution of our products through a channel of systems integrators and OEM partners. Systems integrators, including VARs, use our software products as a component of the biometrics systems they deliver to their customers. OEMs embed our software products in their technology devices or software products. These channel partners typically sell their products and services to government customers.  Our failure to effectively manage our relationships with these third parties could impair the success of our sales, marketing and support activities. Moreover, the activities of these third parties are not within our direct control. The occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results     a reduction in sales efforts by our partners;    the failure of our partners to win government awards in which our products are used;    a reduction in technical capabilities or financial viability of our partners;    a misalignment of interest between us and them;    the termination of our relationship with a major systems integrator or OEM; or    any adverse effect on a partners business related to competition, pricing and other factors.  If the biometrics market does not experience significant growth or if our products do not achieve broad acceptance both domestically and internationally, we may not be able to grow our business.  Our revenues are derived primarily from sales of biometrics products and services. We cannot accurately predict the future growth rate or the size of the biometrics market. The expansion of the biometrics market and the market for our biometrics products and services depends on a number of factors, such as     the cost, performance and reliability of our products and services and the products and services offered by our competitors;    the continued growth in demand for biometrics solutions within the government and law enforcement markets, as well as the development and growth of demand for biometric solutions in markets outside of government and law enforcement;    customers perceptions regarding the benefits of biometrics solutions;    public perceptions regarding the intrusiveness of these solutions and the manner in which organizations use the biometric information collected;    public perceptions regarding the confidentiality of private information;    proposed or enacted legislation related to privacy of information;    customers satisfaction with biometrics solutions; and    marketing efforts and publicity regarding biometrics solutions.  Even if biometrics solutions gain wide market acceptance, our solutions may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue to gain market acceptance. If biometrics solutions generally or our solutions specifically do not gain wide market acceptance, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected.  We face intense competition from other biometrics solutions providers.  A significant number of established companies have developed or are developing and marketing software and hardware for biometrics products and applications that currently compete with or will compete directly with our offerings. We believe that additional competitors will enter the biometrics market and become significant long-term competitors, and that, as a result, competition will increase. Companies competing with us may introduce solutions that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances we have not yet developed or implemented. Our current principal competitors include     Diversified technology providers that offer integrated biometrics solutions to governments, law enforcement agencies and other organizations. This group of competitors includes companies such as Idemia, Thales, and NEC.    Component providers that offer biometrics software and hardware components for fingerprint, facial, iris and voice biometric identification. This group of competitors includes companies such as FaceTec, Dermalog and Innovatrics.  We expect competition to intensify in the near term in the biometrics market. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and research resources than we have. Moreover, low-cost foreign competitors from third world and other countries have demonstrated a willingness to sell their products at significantly reduced prices. To compete effectively in this environment, we must continually develop and market new and enhanced solutions and technologies at competitive prices and must have the resources available to invest in significant research and development activities. Our failure to compete successfully could cause our revenues and market share to decline.  The biometrics industry is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards, which could render our existing products obsolete.  Our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new capabilities and enhancements to our existing products in order to address the changing and sophisticated needs of the marketplace. Frequently, technical development programs in the biometrics industry require assessments to be made of the future direction of technology, which is inherently difficult to predict. Delays in introducing new products and enhancements, the failure to choose correctly among technical alternatives or the failure to offer innovative products or enhancements at competitive prices may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase our competitors products. We may not have adequate resources available to us or may not adequately keep pace with appropriate requirements in order to effectively compete in the marketplace.  Our software products may have errors, defects or bugs, which could result in delayed or lost revenue, expensive correction, liability to our customers, and claims against us.  Complex software products such as ours may contain errors, defects or bugs. Defects in the products that we develop and sell to our customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services. Customers who are not satisfied with any of our products may also bring claims against us for damages, which, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm our reputation, financial results and competitive position.  Our business may be adversely affected by our use of open source software.  The software industry is making increasing use of open source software in the development of products. We also license and integrate certain open source software components from third parties into our software. Open source software license agreements may require that the software code in these components or the software into which they are integrated be freely accessible under open source terms. Many features we may wish to add to our products in the future may be available as open source software and our development team may wish to make use of this software to reduce development costs and speed up the development process. While we carefully monitor the use of all open source software and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, such use could inadvertently occur. If we were required to make our software freely available, our business could be seriously harmed.  We rely on third-party software to develop and provide our solutions and significant defects in third-party software could harm our business.  We rely on software licensed from third parties to develop and offer some of our solutions. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses from third parties to use software or other intellectual property associated with our solutions. We cannot assure you that these licenses will be available to us on acceptable terms, without significant price increases or at all. Any loss of the right to use any such software or other intellectual property required for the development and maintenance of our solutions could result in delays in the provision of our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available from others, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our solutions, which could harm our business.  Part of our future business is dependent on market demand for, and acceptance of, the cloud-based model for the use of software.  We expect to derive a growing percentage of our revenue from the sale of cloud-based services. As a result, widespread acceptance and use of the cloud-based business model is critical to our future growth and success. Under the perpetual or fixed term license model for software procurement, users of the software typically run applications on their hardware. Because companies are generally predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to the concept of accessing the functionality that software provides as a service through a third party. If the market for cloud-based, software solutions ceases to grow or grows slower than we currently anticipate, demand for our services could be negatively affected.  Our operational systems and networks and products may be subject to an increasing risk of continually evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of company or customer confidential information, damage to Awares reputation, additional costs to Aware, regulatory penalties and financial losses.  The company's products, services and systems may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service.  If we or third parties with which we do business were to fall victim to successful cyber-attacks or experience other cybersecurity incidents, including the loss of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack as well as litigation and legal risks, including regulatory actions by state and federal regulators.  Our intellectual property is subject to limited protection.  Because we are a technology provider, our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others is critical to our success. We regard our technology as proprietary. We rely on a combination of U.S. and worldwide patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark law as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology and cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce the patents we own against third parties. Some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Despite our efforts, these measures can only provide limited protection. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, and our business would thus be harmed.  In the future, we may be involved in legal action to enforce our intellectual property rights relating to our patents, copyrights or trade secrets. Any such litigation could be costly and time-consuming for us, even if we were to prevail. Moreover, even if we are successful in protecting our proprietary information, our competitors may independently develop technologies substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. The misappropriation of our technology or the development of competitive technology could seriously harm our business.  We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.  Our technology and products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others. A large and increasing number of participants in the technology industry, including companies known as non-practicing entities, have applied for or obtained patents. Some of these patent holders have demonstrated a readiness to commence litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Third parties have asserted against us in the past and may assert against us in the future patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.  Intellectual property rights can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Moreover, intellectual property claims, with or without merit, can be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management attention away from the execution of our business plan. If we were found to have infringed the proprietary rights of others, we could be subject to substantial damages or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business.  If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be harmed.  If any of our key employees were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Our employment relationships are at-will and we have had key employees leave in the past. We cannot assure you that one or more key employees will not leave in the future. We intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, including software engineers and sales personnel, but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm our business.  Our business may be affected by government laws and regulations.  Extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign law has adversely affected us and could further adversely affect us in ways that are difficult for us to predict. More specifically, we are subject to regulatory environment changes regarding privacy and data protection that could have a material impact on our results of operations. These regulatory changes may potentially involve new regulatory issues requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA , the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act, Texas Statute on the Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier, State of Washington H.B. 1493, Brazils General Data Protection Law  LGPD  and any other state, federal or foreign regulations governing the collection, use and storage of biometric data. The potential costs of compliance with or imposed by new existing regulations and policies that are applicable to us may affect the use of our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  In addition, our business may also be adversely affected by  i  the imposition of tariffs, duties and other import restrictions on goods and services we purchase from non-domestic suppliers; or ii  by the imposition of export restrictions on products we sell internationally. Changes in current or future laws or regulations, in the United States or elsewhere, could seriously harm our business.  Adverse economic conditions could harm our business.  Unfavorable changes in economic conditions, including recessions, inflation, turmoil in financial markets, changes caused by global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other changes in economic conditions, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial conditions as a result of     reduced demand for our products;    increased risk of order cancellations or delays;    increased pressure on the prices for our products;    greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; and    risks to our liquidity, including the possibility that we might not have access to our cash when needed.  We are unable to predict whether or when any such adverse economic conditions could occur in the U.S. or other countries; and if they do occur, nor can we predict their timing, duration, or severity. The longer the duration, the greater the risks we face in operating our business.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.  We may make acquisitions of companies that offer complementary products, services and technologies such as our acquisition of AFIX in November of 2020. The ultimate success of our acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating acquired businesses or assets into our existing businesses. However, the acquisition and successful integration of independent businesses or assets is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and the benefits we realize may not exceed the costs of the acquisition. The risk and difficulties associated with acquiring and integrating companies and other assets include, among others, difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies, challenges in realizing  the value of the acquired assets relative to the price paid, distraction of management from our ongoing businesses and potential product disruptions associated with the sale of the acquired companys products. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Additionally, the consideration we pay for any future acquisitions could include shares of our stock, which could cause dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share.  We may have additional tax liabilities.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States. Significant judgments are required in determining our provisions for income taxes. In the course of preparing our tax provisions and returns, we must make calculations where the ultimate tax determination may be uncertain. Our tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and state tax authorities. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations, and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell the common stock when they want or at prices they find attractive.  The market price of our common stock, like that of other technology companies, is volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including     quarterly variations in operating results;    announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors,    changes in customer relationships, such as the loss of a key customer;    recruitment or departure of key personnel;    corporate actions we may initiate, such as acquisitions, stock sales or repurchases, dividend declarations, or corporate reorganizations; and    other events or factors.  Our stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to our performance. As a result, purchasers of our common stock may be unable at any given time to sell their shares at or above the price they paid for them. Moreover, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock often are subject to securities class action litigation. If we were the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.  If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.  As a public company, we are required to enhance and test our financial, internal and management control systems to meet obligations imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Consistent with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC, management's assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting is required in connection with our filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to identify, implement and conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may also uncover weaknesses or other issues with these controls that could also result in adverse investor reaction.  We must make judgments in the process of preparing our financial statements.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and certain critical accounting policies that are relevant to our business. The application of these principles and policies requires us to make significant judgments and estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements pertain to revenue recognition, reserves for doubtful accounts, valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in business combination and valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. In the event that our judgments and estimates differ from actual results, we may have to change them, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.  Moreover, accounting standards have been subject to rapid change and evolving interpretations by accounting standards setting organizations over the past few years. The implementation of new accounting standards requires us to interpret and apply them appropriately. If our current interpretations or applications are later found to be incorrect, we may have to restate our financial statements and the price of our stock could decline."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table sets forth, for the years indicated, certain line items from our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income stated as a percentage of total revenue   Year ended  December 31,  Revenue   Software licenses        Software maintenance  Services  Total revenue  Costs and expenses   Cost of services  Research and development  Selling and marketing  General and administrative  Total costs and expenses  Operating loss   83      34     Interest income  Loss before provision for  benefit from  income taxes   81      26     Provision for  benefit from  income taxes   14     Net loss   67       68      Summary of Operations  We are primarily engaged in the development and sale of biometrics products, solutions and services. Our software products are used in government and commercial systems and applications and fulfill a broad range of functions critical to secure biometric enrollment, authentication, identification and transactions. Principal government applications of biometrics systems include border control, visa applicant screening, law enforcement, national defense, intelligence, secure credentialing, access control, and background checks. Principal commercial applications include  i  user enrollment and authentication used for login to mobile devices, computers, networks, and software programs; ii  user authentication for financial transactions and purchases  online and in-person ; iii  physical access control to buildings; and iv  identity proofing of prospective employees and customers. We sell our biometrics software products and services globally through a multifaceted distribution strategy using systems integrators, OEMs, VARs, partners, and directly to end user customers. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the sale of imaging software licenses to OEMs and systems integrators that incorporate our software into medical imaging products and medical systems.  Summary of Financial Results  We used revenue and operating loss to summarize financial results over the past two years as we believe these measurements are the most meaningful way to understand our operating performance.  2020 compared to 2019  Revenue and operating loss in 2020 were  11.3 million and  9.4 million, respectively, which compared to revenue and operating loss in 2019 of  12.2 million and  4.1 million, respectively.  Lower revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower services revenue related to a software license agreement, we entered with a systems integrator in the second quarter of 2018 for a large project where we performed significantly more services in 2019 as compared to 2020. This was partially offset by higher subscription revenue. Lower operating income in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to  i  lower revenue in 2020; and ii  higher total costs and expenses in 2020.  Software License Revenue  Software license revenue consists of revenue from the sale of biometrics and imaging software products. Sales of software products depend on our ability to win proposals to supply software for biometrics systems projects either directly to end user customers or indirectly through channel partners.  Software license revenue increased 9  from  4.6 million in 2019 to  5.0 million in 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, software license revenue increased from 38  in 2019 to 45  in 2020. The  0.4 million increase in software license revenue was primarily due to a  0.3 million increase in biometrics software license sales and a  0.1 million increase in imaging software license sales. The reasons for the changes in biometrics and imaging software licenses were   i   Biometrics software licenses - Biometrics software license sales were  4.1 million in 2020 versus  3.8 million in 2019. The dollar increase was primarily due to higher subscription revenue of  0.6 million. This was partially offset by lower license revenue of  0.4 million.  ii   Imaging software licenses - Imaging software license sales were  0.9 million in 2020 versus  0.8 million in 2019. The dollar increase was primarily due to higher imaging license sales to our systems integrator customers in 2020.  Software Maintenance Revenue  Software maintenance revenue consists of revenue from the sale of software maintenance contracts. Software maintenance contracts entitle customers to receive software support and software updates, if and when they become available, during the term of the contract.  Software maintenance revenue increased 3  from  5.3 million in 2019 to  5.4 million in 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, software maintenance revenue increased from 43  in 2019 to 48  in 2020.  A majority of our customers purchase software maintenance contracts when they initially purchase software licenses. Since our software is used in active biometrics systems, many of our customers continue to renew their maintenance contracts in subsequent years while systems remain operational.  Services Revenue  Services revenue consists of fees we charge to perform software development, integration, installation, and customization services. Similar to software license revenue, services revenue depends on our ability to win biometrics systems projects either directly with end user customers or in conjunction with channel partners. Services revenue will fluctuate when we commence new projects and or when we complete projects that were started in previous periods.  Services decreased 64  from  2.3 million in 2019 to  0.8 million in 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, services decreased from 19  in 2019 to 7  in 2020. The dollar decrease in services revenue was primarily due to lower services revenue related to the software license agreement we entered into with a systems integrator in the second quarter of 2018 for a large project where we performed significantly more services in 2019 as compared to 2020 and to a less extent lower services revenue from other system integrators.  Cost of Services  Cost of services consists of engineering costs to perform customer services projects. Such costs primarily include  i  engineering salaries, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits, and facilities; and ii  engineering consultants and contractors.  Cost of services decreased 4  from  1.3 million in 2019 to  0.8 million in 2020. Cost of services as a percentage of services revenue increased from 54  in 2019 to 96  in 2020, which means that gross margins on services decreased from 46  in 2019 to 4  in 2020. The dollar decrease in cost of services was primarily due to a large project with a systems integrator that we signed in the second quarter of 2018.  Gross margins on services of 4  and 46 , in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were a function of  i  the nature of the projects; ii  the level of engineering difficulty and labor hours required to complete project tasks; and iii  how much we were able to charge. Gross margins in these years reflect the profitability mix of customer projects. We expect  that gross margins on services will continue to fluctuate in future periods based on the nature, complexity, and pricing of future projects.  Research and Development Expense  Research and development expense consists of costs for  i  engineering personnel, including salaries, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits, and facilities; ii  engineering consultants and contractors, and iii  other engineering expenses such as supplies, equipment depreciation, dues and memberships and travel. Engineering costs incurred to develop our technology and products are classified as research and development expense. As described in the cost of services section, engineering costs incurred to provide engineering services for customer projects are classified as cost of services and are not included in research and development expense.  The classification of total engineering costs to research and development expense and cost of services was  in thousands    Years ended  December 31,  Research and development expense     9,093     7,928  Cost of services  1,261  Total engineering costs     9,903     9,189  Research and development expense increased 8  from 2019 to 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, research and development expense increased from 75  in 2019 to 87  in 2020.  Total engineering costs increased by  0.7 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. The spending increase was primarily due to higher employee costs of  1.3 million. The increase was partially offset by a  0.6 million reduction in spending on third-party software development costs. Our engineering headcount increased by six to 52 in 2020. We believe our engineering organization was adequately staffed as of December 31, 2020.  As we described in the Part I-Business of this Form 10-K, we intend to introduce new products that will allow us to offer more complete biometrics solutions. We believe this strategy will allow us to sell more software into biometrics systems projects in order to grow our revenue. Our preference is to develop such products internally, however to the extent we are unable to do that, we may purchase or license technologies from third parties. We anticipate that we will continue to focus our future research and development activities on enhancing existing products and developing new products.  Selling and Marketing Expense  Selling and marketing expense primarily consists of costs for  i  sales and marketing personnel, including salaries, sales commissions, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits, travel, and facilities; and ii  advertising and promotion expenses.  Sales and marketing expense increased by 50  from  3.6 million in 2019 to  5.4 million in 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expense increased from 30  in 2019 to 48  in 2020. The dollar increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due increased headcount related costs of  1.7M and higher professional services of  0.5 million. This increase was partially offset by lower travel costs of  0.2 million due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and lower sales commission of  0.2 million due to lower revenue.  General and Administrative Expense  General and administrative expense consists primarily of costs for  i  officers, directors and administrative personnel, including salaries, bonuses, director compensation, stock-based compensation, fringe benefits, and facilities; ii  professional fees, including legal and audit fees; iii  public company expenses; and iv  other administrative expenses, such as insurance costs and bad debt provisions.  General and administrative expense increased by 51  from  3.6 million in 2019 to  5.4 million in 2020. As a percentage of total revenue, general and administrative expense increased from 29  in 2019 to 48  in 2020. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2020 was primarily due to costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and turnover of over 50  our administrative personnel. Costs included  0.7 million of severance and transition  expense,  0.2 million of legal fees,  0.1 million of bad debt expense and  0.2 million of expense related to remote working. Also contributing to increased general and administrative expenses were  0.3 million of higher employee costs due to increased headcount legal and professional fees of  0.4 million.  Interest Income  Interest income decreased by 82  from  1.0 million in 2019 to  0.2 million in 2020. The dollar decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates within our money market accounts.  Income Taxes  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and we use estimates in determining our provisions for income taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates.  A discussion of income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019 follows   Year ended December 31, 2020. Total income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  1.6 million. The income tax benefit for 2020 was primarily due to the tax benefit of the current year tax loss which can be carried back due to changes made by the CARES Act.  Year ended December 31, 2019. Total income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2019 was  5.2 million. The income tax provision for 2019 was primarily due to a change in valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  In recent years, we have financed the company with our cash balances, cash generated from operations, and cash received from the sale of patent assets. Equity financing has not been a meaningful source of financing for us in recent years. Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are described below.  Cash flow from operating activities  A discussion of cash flow from operating activities for each of the last two years is as follows   Year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used by operating activities was  5.3 million in 2020. Cash used by operations was primarily the result of  7.6 million of net loss, partially offset by  0.8 million of changes in assets and liabilities and by the add back of  1.5 million of non-cash items for depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation.  Year ended December 31, 2019. Cash used by operating activities was  2.9 million in 2019. Cash used by operations was primarily the result of  8.3 million of net loss, and  0.9 million of changes in assets and liabilities. This was partially offset by the add back of  6.3 million of non-cash items for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred tax assets.  Cash flow from investing activities  In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our investing activities used net cash of  2.9 million and  0.1 million, respectively. A discussion of cash flow from investing activities for each of the last two years is as follows   Year ended December 31, 2020. Investing activity cash usage was primarily the result of  2.4 million used in connection with our acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of AFIX product suite and  0.5 million of purchases of property and equipment.  Year ended December 31, 2019. Investing activity cash usage was primarily the result of purchases of property and equipment. We have no material commitments for capital expenditures.  Cash flow from financing activities  In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our financing activities used net cash of  1.0 million and  0.8 million, respectively. A discussion of cash flow from financing activities for each of the last two years is as follows   Year ended December 31, 2020. Financing activity cash usage was primarily the result of  0.9 million used to buy back stock under our stock repurchase program and  0.1 million used to pay income taxes for employees who surrendered shares in connection with stock grants.  Year ended December 31, 2019. Financing activity cash usage was primarily the result of  0.8 million used to buy back stock under our stock repurchase program and  0.1 million used to pay income taxes for employees who surrendered shares in connection with stock grants.  At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of  38.6 million. While we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing, or that if needed such financing will be available to us, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance, however, that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We do not currently have any arrangements with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose entities, or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Accordingly, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk if we had such relationships.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The Companys significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.  Revenue recognition. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification  ASC , Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ASC 606 , revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods and services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. In addition, ASC 606 requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The core principle of the standard is that we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, we apply the following five step model   1.  Identify the contract with the customer;  2.  Identify the performance obligations in the contract;  3.  Determine the transaction price;  4.  Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and  5.  Recognize revenue when  or as  each performance obligation is satisfied.  We categorize revenue as software licenses, software maintenance, or services. Revenue from software licenses is recognized at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. We recognize software maintenance revenue over time on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Services revenue is recognized over time as the services are delivered using an input method  i.e., labor hours incurred as a percentage of total labor hours budgeted , provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.  In addition to selling software licenses, software maintenance and software services on a standalone basis, a significant portion of our contracts include multiple performance obligations, which require an allocation of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price  SSP  basis. The SSP is the price  at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The best estimate of SSP is the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately. A contractually stated price or a list price for a good or service may be the SSP of that good or service. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the goods and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that needs to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various goods and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we typically determine the SSP using an adjusted market assessment approach using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual goods and services due to the stratification of those goods and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the nature of the customer and distribution channel in determining the SSP.  When software licenses and significant customization engineering services are sold together, they are accounted for as a combined performance obligation, as the software licenses are generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the associated customization services and therefore are not distinct performance obligations. Revenue for the combined performance obligation is recognized over time as the services are delivered using an input method  i.e., labor hours incurred as a percentage of total labor hours budgeted .  When software subscription licenses are sold, the term software license and software maintenance are generally considered distinct performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the term software license and the software maintenance based on relative SSP. We sell our software subscription license for a fixed fee or a usage-based royalty fee, sometimes subject to a minimum guarantee. When the amount is in the form of a fixed fee, including the guaranteed minimum in usage-based royalty, revenue allocated to the term software license is recognized at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Any royalties not subject to the guaranteed minimum or earned in excess of the minimum amount are recognized as revenue when the subsequent usage occurs. Revenue allocated to the software maintenance is recognized over the contract term.  The amount of consideration is not adjusted for a significant financing component if the time between payment and the transfer of the related good or service is expected to be one year or less under the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18. Our revenue arrangements are typically accounted for under such expedient, as payment is typically due within 30 to 60 days. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of our contracts contained a significant financing component.  Stock-Based Compensation. We grant stock and stock options to our employees and directors. We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the applicable vesting period of the award on a straight-line basis.  For stock awards, we determine the fair value of the award by using the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant; provided the number of shares in the grant is fixed on the grant date.  For stock options, we use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of the award. This valuation model takes into account the exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of significant assumptions. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected term, the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the expected term, and our expected annual dividend yield.  Income taxes. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our actual current tax expense. We must also estimate temporary and permanent differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period for deferred tax assets, which have been recognized, we must include an expense with the tax provision in the statement of operations. Conversely, to the extent we decrease our valuation allowance in a period for deferred tax assets, which have been previously reserved, we must include a tax benefit with the tax provision in the statement of operations.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act  CARES Act  was signed into law on March 27, 2020. The Act contained specific relief and stimulus measures including allowing net operating losses originating in 2018 through 2020 to be carried back five years to offset taxable income in the carryback period.  Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets, and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets primarily relate to  i  research and development tax credit carryforwards related to excess stock compensation benefits; ii  net operating loss carryforwards; and iii  temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of  8.7 million of deferred tax assets for which we have recorded an  8.7 million valuation allowance. Also, we have recognized the tax benefit of the amount of our current year loss that can be carried back to recover taxes paid in earlier years.  We will continue to assess the level of valuation allowance required in future periods. Should evidence regarding the realizability of tax assets change at a future point in time, the valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly.  Allowance for doubtful accounts. We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for receivables when collection becomes doubtful. Provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. If the judgments we make to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be required.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  issued Accounting Standard Update  ASU  No. 2019-12, Income Taxes  Topic 740   Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The ASU was issued to reduce the complexity of the reporting information for financial statement users. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of the standard did not result in any adjustment to our financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  Topic 326   Measurement of Credit Losses of Financial Instruments, which changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. This guidance was to be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  Topic 326 , Derivatives and Hedging  Topic 815 , and Leases  Topic842  Effective Dates, which deferred the effective dates for us, as a smaller reporting company, until fiscal year 2023. We are continuing to assess the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements."}

This capability also provides cost advantages, rapid response to market needs, simplified processes for boarding business and a seamless interface for our merchant customers.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Those estimates and judgments are based upon our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies include   Revenue Recognition  The Company generates revenue principally from the sales related to the label generation services, shipping calculator services, brewery management software subscriptions, merchant processing services, and client services.  The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 606. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues when the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  For label generation service revenues the Company recognizes revenue when a customer has successfully prepared a shipping label and had a pickup. The service is offered to consumers via an online registration and allows users to create a shipping label using a credit card on their account  all customers must have a valid credit card on file to process shipments on the ShipTime platform .  For shipping calculator revenues and brewery management software and other subscription-based revenues, the Company recognizes subscription revenue on a monthly basis. Shipping calculator customers renewal dates are based on their date of installation and registration of the shipping calculator line of products. The timing of the revenue recognition and cash collection may vary within a given quarter and the deposits for future services are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Brewery management software subscribers are billed monthly at the first of the month. All payments are made via credit card for the month following.  For payment processing services, the Company recognizes revenue based on daily transactions by our partners and merchants. Customers process credit card payments for sales and remit fees based on the number of transactions and percent of the processed amounts. The merchant bank deposits the funds to the customer net of fees. The remainder of the fees withheld is disbursed to the Company on a daily basis, net of interchange and other transactional charges.  Foreign Currency  The currencies of ShipTime, the Companys international subsidiary, are in Canadian dollars. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2020. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Long-Lived Assets  The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the expected future cash flow from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and measured using the fair value of the related asset. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Companys services will continue, which could result in additional impairment of long-lived assets in the future.  Share- Based Compensation  The Board of Directors has on occasion voted to award stock options or common shares preferred shares to employees or directors. The price at which the option shares may be purchased is based on the fair market value of the shares on the date of the agreement. Each recipients option agreement may differ; the vesting terms may vary from fully vested immediately to one-third immediately, one-third vesting in 18 months and the final one-third vesting in 36 months from the date of the grant or one-third immediately, one-third vesting on January 1, 2019 and one-third vesting on January 1, 2020. Historically the options granted have had a 10-year term. If the recipients employment or relationship with the Company is terminated the options recipient may be allowed up to three months to exercise their options. Option compensation is calculated by using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards.  Leases  A right-of-use asset represents a lessees right to use a leased asset for the term of the lease. Our right-of-use assets generally consist of an operating lease for a building. Right-of-use assets are measured initially at the present value of the lease payments, plus any lease payments made before a lease began and any initial direct costs, such as commissions paid to obtain a lease. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, adjusted for incentives, prepaid or accrued rent, and any initial direct costs not yet expensed.  We have an operating lease for our corporate offices in Canada and finance leases for furniture and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of six months to thirty-two months, and our primary operating leases include options to extend the leases for four years. Future renewal options that are not likely to be executed as of the balance sheet date are excluded from right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities.  We report operating leased assets, as well as operating lease current and noncurrent obligations on our balance sheets for the right to use the building in our business. Our finance leases represent furniture and office equipment; we report the furniture and equipment, as well as finance lease current and noncurrent obligations on our balance sheet.  Generally, interest rates are stated in our leases for equipment. When no interest rate is stated in a lease, however, we review the interest rates implicit in our recent finance leases to estimate our incremental borrowing rate. We determine the rate implicit in a lease by using the most recent finance lease rate, or other method we think most closely represents our incremental borrowing rate.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and  The following discussion compares the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 with those for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion.  Revenues  The following table compares total revenue for the periods indicated.  Years ended December 31,    Change  Client services   3,541   19,395   82    Shipping calculator services  27,845  148,035   81    Brewery management software  114,881  193,150   41    Merchant processing services  425,839  2,011  21,071   Shipping coordination and label generation services  12,348,683  10,185,704  21   Total revenues   12,920,789   10,548,295  22   Revenues increased 22  in 2020 primarily from the continued growth of the shipping coordination and label generation services and the addition of merchant processing services to the Companys revenue stream.  Client services revenues decreased  15,854 or 82  to  3,541 compared to  19,395 in 2019. The decrease was attributable to depleting inventory of our movie posters available for auction.  Shipping calculator services revenues decreased  120,190 or 81  to  27,845 compared to  148,035 in 2019. The decrease was attributed to discontinuance of billable services for a portion of the AuctionInc products. The Company is preparing to launch a new platform where the new clients will be migrated to.  Brewery management software revenues decreased  78,269 or 41  to  114,881 in 2020 compared to  193,150 in 2019. The decrease is attributable to the additional competition in the brewery management software industry and the limited marketing to new clients.  Merchant processing services is a new segment for the Company launched in late 2019. This segment has contributed to the overall growth of the Company increasing  423,828 to  425,839 in 2020 from  2,011 in 2019. These services also have a higher gross margin and gross profit. They will continue to be a source of growth for the Company.  Shipping coordination and label generation service revenues increased  2,162,979 or 21  to  12,348,683 in 2020 compared to  10,185,704 in 2019. The increase is attributable to the increase in marketing efforts along with the impact of COVID-19 on the small businesses and their ability to sell and ship online.  Gross Profit  Gross profit increased  364,548 or 13  to  3,111,289 in 2020 compared to  2,746,741 in 2019. Gross margin decreased 2 percentage points to 24  in 2020 from 26  in 2019. The decrease in gross margin was partially due to the increase in revenue from our shipping label generation services which are offered at a lower margin.  Operating Expenses  Total operating expenses in 2020 were  5,242,763 compared to  3,458,774 in 2019, an increase of  1,783,989 or 52 . The increase is mainly due to the share-based compensation for 2020.  Other Income Expense, net  Net other income in 2020 was  21,128 compared to  991,840 in the same period of 2019, a decrease of  970,712. This is primarily attributable to the gain recorded on the elimination of the stock price guarantee in 2019.  Net Income  Loss   The Company reported a net loss in 2020 of   2,232,553  compared to a net income of  282,011 for the same period in 2019. The basic loss per common share in 2020 represents   0.41  while the basic net income per common share in 2019 represents  0.06.  Inflation  The Company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its results of operations.  Operating Cash Flows  A summarized reconciliation of the Company's net income  loss  to cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows   Net income  loss     2,232,553    282,011  Provision for bad debts  20,125  -  Depreciation and amortization  488,745  490,250  Amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets  28,545  22,850  Share-based compensation  2,452,701  407,974  Other income from stock price guarantee  -   880,553   Deferred income taxes   120,835    73,208   Gain on sale of property and equipment   739   -  Unrealized loss on stock price guarantee  -   3,688   Changes in current assets and liabilities  464,820   230,103   Net cash provided by operating activities   1,100,809   15,533  Working Capital and Liquidity  The Company had cash and cash equivalents of  1,644,210 on December 31, 2020 compared to  475,881 at December 31, 2019. The Company had working capital of  218,615 as of December 31, 2020 compared to a working capital deficit of  397,891 at December 31, 2019, an improvement of  616,506. The improvement in working capital is primarily attributed to the cash on hand at year end.  Management believes that the Company has adequate cash resources to fund operations during the next 12 months. In addition, management continues to explore opportunities and has organized additional resources to monetize its patents. However, there can be no assurance that anticipated growth in new business will occur, and that the Company will be successful in launching new products and services. Management continues to seek alternative sources of capital to support the growth of future operations."}

SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasingly required, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewing habits are shifting. The primary driver of our business is enabling the delivery of video content in the changing multiscreen television environment. We have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players.

Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serve adjacent markets. Our core technologies provide a foundation for software products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber activity across multiple devices.  We have implemented restructuring programs and cost saving initiatives during the past three years to improve operations and optimize our cost structure. In fiscal 2020, we streamlined our operations and closed our service organizations in Ireland and the Netherlands, for which we realized annualized cost savings of approximately  6.0 million. In the first half of fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for which we expect approximately  7.6 million of annualized savings. Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in an effort to further reduce cost.  In February 2019, we acquired Xstream A S, a leading OTT media cloud platform provider with its primary operations in Warsaw, Poland. Xstream provides a managed service, OTT video solution that serves more than five million active subscribers globally. Xstreams MediaMaker video platform has enhanced the SeaChange end-to-end video framework. We have used the acquisition of Xstream to accelerate our penetration in OTT and new market segments and a fully cloud-based end-to-end video platform that operates in a hosted managed service environment.  In February 2019, we entered into a cooperation agreement  the Cooperation Agreement  with TAR Holdings LLC and Karen Singer  collectively, TAR Holdings . As of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, TAR Holdings beneficially owned approximately 20.6  of our outstanding common stock.

Messrs. Pons and Tuder were subsequently re-elected in the 2019 and 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, respectively. On January 8, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer resigned, and Mr. Pons was subsequently appointed Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer in the interim.  In March 2019, our Board approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan  the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan  to deter acquisitions of our common stock that would potentially limit our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes  NOLs  to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations. In connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019 to our stockholders of record on that date. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.  In February 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC , which registered an indeterminate number of shares of common stock, preferred stock, Series A Participating Preferred Stock, warrants or rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock, and units  collectively, the Securities  using a shelf registration or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of  200 million. The shelf registration was declared effective on March 16, 2021.  In connection with the shelf registration statement, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. on March 30, 2021, to issue and sell 10,323,484 shares of common stock,  0.01 par value per share, at a public offering price of  1.85 per share  the Offering . The Offering closed on April 1, 2021 and resulted in approximately  17.6 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5 , or  0.12025 per share of common stock, and estimated offering expenses of approximately  0.2 million. In addition to the Offering, the Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,548,522 shares of common stock at a purchase price of  1.85 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.  In March 2021, we entered into a Sublease Termination Agreement  the Termination Agreement  to our current headquarters office lease at 500 Totten Pond Road, Waltham, Massachusetts that provides for an early termination of such sublease effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease the Company will pay the sublandlord a termination payment of approximately  430 thousand against an obligation of approximately  2.8 million. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025.

The majority of our research and development efforts are performed by our engineering and development team in Warsaw, Poland.  SELLING AND MARKETING  Our sales cycle has historically been long, in some instances up to 12-24 months. Framework engagements can be large and span for multiple years and it can be difficult to predict in what fiscal period the sale will occur. We primarily utilize a direct sales process and work closely with customers to understand and define their needs. We use several marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of Framework. We also market certain features of Framework to systems integrators and value-added resellers. We attend and exhibit Framework at a limited number of prominent industry trade shows and conferences, when available, and we present our technology at seminars and smaller conferences to promote awareness.  OUR CUSTOMERS  We currently sell our products primarily to video service providers, such as cable system operators and telecommunications companies, as well as content providers. Historically, a significant portion of our revenue in any given fiscal period has been derived from substantial orders placed by these large organizations. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, one customer accounted for more than 10  of our total revenue.  We expect that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the near future, even as we intend to penetrate new markets and customers. As a result of this customer concentration, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the failure of anticipated orders to materialize and by deferrals or cancellations of orders because of changes in customer requirements or new product announcements or introductions. In addition, the concentration of customers may cause variations in revenue, expenses and operating results on a quarterly basis due to seasonality of orders, the timing and relative size of orders received and accepted during a fiscal quarter, or the timing and size of orders for which revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied during a fiscal quarter.  COMPETITION  The markets in which we compete are characterized by intense competition, with many suppliers providing different types of products to different segments of the markets. In new markets for our products, we compete based on price, functionality and delivery capabilities. In markets in which we have an established presence, we compete principally based on the breadth of our products features and benefits, including the flexibility, scalability, professional quality, ease of use, reliability and cost effectiveness of our products, and our reputation and the depth of our expertise, customer service and support. While we believe that we currently compete favorably overall with respect to these factors and that our ability to provide integrated solutions to manage and distribute digital video differentiates us from our competitors, in the future we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to these factors.  In the market for multiscreen video, we compete with various larger companies offering video platforms and applications such as Synamedia, Arris Group Inc., TiVo and MediaKind, as well as in-house solutions built by the service providers. Increasingly, we are also seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and many OTT providers. We expect the competition in each of the markets in which we operate to intensify in the future with existing and new competitors with significant market presence and financial resources.  Many of our current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Moreover, these companies may introduce additional products that are competitive with ours or enter strategic relationships to offer complete solutions. Therefore, our products may not be able to compete effectively with these products from these companies in the future.  PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  Our success and our ability to compete are dependent, in part, upon the proprietary rights of our intellectual property. We currently have 16 patents in the United States  U.S.  expiring between 2022 and 2032. In addition, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademark laws, trade secrets and copyright laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. It is possible that the validity of these patents would not be upheld.  It is also possible that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property will be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be distributed do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Currently, we are not party to intellectual property litigation, but we may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others intellectual property.  HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  As of January 31, 2021, we had 153 employees worldwide, of whom 29 were in our U.S. operations and 124 were in our international operations. All employees as of January 31, 2021 were full-time employees with the exception of 3 part-time employees. We also use other temporary employees and contractors in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by local works council as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions.  Total Rewards  We offer competitive wages, annual bonus opportunities, a 401 k  retirement savings plan for U.S. employees, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, and flexible work schedules.  Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented operational changes with the primary objective to provide safety to our employees and to comply with government regulations. We have adopted a distributed workforce model, including for some employees, a long-term, full-time work from home arrangement, while implementing additional safety measures for employees and contractors continuing essential and critical on-site work.

RISK FACTORS  We wish to caution each reader of this Form 10-K to consider the following factors and other factors discussed herein and in other past reports, including but not limited to prior year Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the SEC. Our business and results of operations could be materially affected by any of the following risks. The factors discussed herein are not exhaustive. Therefore, the factors contained herein should be read together with other reports that we file with the SEC from time to time, which may supplement, modify, supersede, or update the factors listed in this document.

Risk Factors Summary  Risks Related to Our Business and Operations    Our business is dependent on customers continued spending on video solutions and services. A reduction in spending by customers would adversely affect our business.    Our efforts to introduce SaaS-based multiscreen service offerings may either not succeed or impair the sale of our on-site licensed offerings, the occurrence of either of which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.    We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to become a company that primarily provides software solutions.    If we fail to respond to rapidly changing technologies related to multiscreen video, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected because the competitive advantage of our products and services relative to those of our competitors would decrease.    We have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, which could have long-term negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand.    Because our customer base has been highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, the loss of reduced demand by, or the return of product by one or more of these customers or the failure of revenue acceptance criteria to have been satisfied in a given fiscal quarter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Cancellation or deferral of purchases of our products or final customer acceptance could cause a substantial variation in our operating results, resulting in a decrease in the market price of our common stock and making period-to-period comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.    Adoption of our value based selling approach for our products and services may adversely impact our revenues and operating results.    Due to the lengthy sales cycle involved in the sale of our products, our quarterly results may vary and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.    If there were a decline in demand or average selling prices for our products and services, our revenue and operating results would be materially affected.    We enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.    If our software products contain serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.    We have experienced turnover in our senior management, which could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and could hinder the execution of our growth strategy.    Restructuring programs could have a material negative impact on our business.    If our indefinite-lived or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.    The recent COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Risks Related to our Dependence on Third-Parties    If we are not able to obtain necessary licenses, services or distribution rights for third-party technology at acceptable prices, or at all, our products could become obsolete or we may not be able to deliver certain product offerings.    Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities or our enterprise cloud computing providers could impair the delivery of our service, adversely affect our financial results and otherwise harm our business.    Our products are often integrated with other third-party products. Third-party delays could adversely affect our future financial operating results.    Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our third-party vendors.    Because we purchase certain components used in assembling some of our products from sole suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a failure of these suppliers to provide these components.    A disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations and impact our revenue and profitability.  Risks Related to Our Industry    We operate in a relatively new and rapidly developing market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.    If we fail to develop and consistently deliver innovative technologies and services in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries, our business could decline.    Our future success is dependent on the manner in which the multiscreen video and OTT markets develop, and if these markets develop in a manner that does not facilitate inclusion of our products and services, our business may not continue to grow.    If content providers limit the scope of content licensed for use in the digital VOD and OTT market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected because the potential market for our products would be more limited than we currently believe and have communicated to the financial markets.    There is no assurance that the current cost of Internet connectivity and network access will not rise with the increasing popularity of online media services.    We have been and, in the future, could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights.  Risks Related to Regulatory Matters    The success of our business model could be influenced by changes in the regulatory environment, such as changes that either would limit capital expenditures by television, cable or telecommunications operators or reverse the trend towards deregulation in the industries in which we compete.    Uncertainties of regulation of the Internet and data traveling over the Internet could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.    Evolving data privacy regulations, including the EUs General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , and the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA , may subject us to significant penalties.    We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  FCPA , and our failure to comply could result in penalties that could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.  Risks Related to Our Acquisitions    We may not fully realize the benefits of our completed acquisitions or it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits. Future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.  Risks Related to Our International Operations    We face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas, which, if not properly managed, could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property and increased costs due to inefficient and poor work product, which could harm our business, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.    Because our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations, we may not be able to maintain or increase international sales of our products and services.  Risks Related to Our Common Stock    Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement, any of which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable.  Risks Related to Our Business and Operations  Our business is dependent on customers continued spending on video solutions and services. A reduction in spending by customers would adversely affect our business.  Our performance is dependent on customers continued spending for video solutions and services. Spending for these systems and services is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of spending, and, therefore, our sales and profits, including     general economic conditions; customer specific financial or stock market conditions;    availability and cost of capital;    governmental regulation;    demand for services;    competition from other providers of video solutions and services;    acceptance by our customers; and    real or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors.  Any reduction in spending by our customers would adversely affect our business. We continue to have limited visibility into the capital spending plans of our current and prospective customers. Fluctuations in our revenue can lead to even greater fluctuations in our operating results. Our planned expense levels depend in part on our expectations of future revenue. Our planned expenses include significant investments, particularly within our research and development organization, which we believe are necessary to continue to provide innovative solutions to meet our current and prospective customers needs. As a result, it is difficult to forecast revenue and operating results. If our revenue and operating results are below the expectations of our investors and market analysts, it could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.  Our efforts to introduce SaaS-based multiscreen service offerings may either not succeed or impair the sale of our on-site licensed offerings, the occurrence of either of which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  We have devoted, and will continue to devote, considerable resources, including the allocation of capital expenditures to growing our SaaS service offering revenue over the next several years. There can be no assurance that we will meet our revenue targets for this service and if we fail to achieve our revenue goals, our growth and operating results will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, new or existing customers may choose to purchase our SaaS services rather than our on-premise solutions. If our customers purchases trend away from perpetual licenses toward our SaaS, or to the extent customers defer orders due to evaluation of SaaS, our product revenue, and our timing of revenue generally, may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to become a company that primarily provides software solutions.  Our efforts to become a company that primarily provides software solutions may result in a reduction in both the range of products and services we offer and in the range of our current and potential future customers. Each of these factors may increase the level of execution risk in our strategy, in that there may be increased variability in our revenue. If we are unsuccessful in this transition, our business, financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock may decrease.  If we are unable to successfully compete in our marketplace, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.  We currently compete against companies offering video software solutions and have increasingly seen competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and a large number of OTT players. To the extent the products developed are competitive with and not complementary to our products, they may be more cost-effective than our solutions, which could result in cable television system operators and telecommunications companies discontinuing their purchases of our on-demand products. Due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete, additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources, such as in-house solutions and online video platforms, may enter those markets, thereby further intensifying competition. Increased competition could result in price reductions, cancellations of purchase orders, losses of business with current customers to competitors, and loss of market share which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, selling and marketing, technical and other resources than we do. They may be in better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. Moreover, our competitors may also foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do. Although we believe that we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, realizing and maintaining these advantages will require a continued high level of investment by us in research and product development, marketing and customer service and support. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected because of the difference in our operating results from the assumptions on which our business model is based.  If we fail to respond to rapidly changing technologies related to multiscreen video, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected because the competitive advantage of our products and services relative to those of our competitors would decrease.  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Future technological advances in the television and video industries may result in the availability of new products or services that could compete with the solutions provided by us or reduce the cost of existing products or services, any of which could enable our existing or potential customers to fulfill their video needs better and more cost efficiently than with our products. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing video products, including the development of new applications for our technology, and to develop and introduce new products to meet and adapt to changing customer requirements and emerging technologies such as the OTT market. In the future, we may not be successful in enhancing our video products or developing and marketing new products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. In addition, there may be services, products or technologies developed by others that render our products or technologies uncompetitive, unmarketable or obsolete, or announcements of currently planned or other new product offerings either by us or our competitors that cause customers to defer or fail to purchase our existing solutions.  We have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, which could have long-term negative effects on our business or impact our ability to adequately address a rapid increase in customer demand.  We have taken and continue to take measures to address the variability in the market for our products and services, including due to the impact of worldwide economic cycles, to increase average revenue per unit of our sales and to reduce our operating expenses, rationalize capital expenditure and minimize customer turnover. These measures include shifting more of our operations to lower cost regions by outsourcing and off-shoring, implementing cost reduction programs and reducing and rationalizing planned capital expenditures and expense budgets. We cannot ensure that the measures we have taken will not impair our ability to effectively develop and market products and services, to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete, to operate effectively, to operate profitably during slowdowns or to effectively meet a rapid increase in customer demand. These measures may have long-term negative effects on our business by reducing our pool of technical talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products and services, making it more difficult to hire and retain talented individuals and to quickly respond to customers or competitors in an upward cycle.  Because our customer base has been highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, the loss of reduced demand by, or the return of product by one or more of these customers or the failure of revenue acceptance criteria to have been satisfied in a given fiscal quarter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our customer base is highly concentrated among a limited number of large customers, and, therefore, a limited number of customers account for a significant percentage of our revenue in any fiscal period. Our sales to specific customers tend to vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter depending upon these customers budgets for capital expenditures and our new product introductions. We believe that a significant amount of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of large customers in the future. The loss of, reduced demand for products or related services by, or return of a product previously purchased by any of our major customers or the failure of revenue acceptance criteria to have been satisfied in a given fiscal quarter, could materially and adversely affect, either in a particular quarter or on a more long-term basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations.  If we are unable to retain our existing customers, our revenue and results of operations will be adversely affected.  A portion of our business is subscription-based and as we seek to accelerate our penetration in OTT and serving new market segments with a SaaS revenue model, we will expand our subscription-based model. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription period expires, and we will experience losses of customers that elect not to renew, in some cases, for reasons beyond our control. Even if subscriptions are renewed, they may not be renewed on the same or on more profitable terms. As a result, our ability to retain our existing customers and grow depends in part on subscription renewals. We may not be able to accurately predict future trends in customer renewals, and our customers renewal rates have and may continue to fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the cost of our services and the cost of services offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers and their end users spending levels or the introduction by competitors of attractive features and functionality. If our customer retention rate decreases, we may need to increase the rate at which we add new customers in order to maintain and grow our revenue, which may require us to incur significantly higher sales and marketing expenses than we currently anticipate, or our revenue may decline. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or subscriptions, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline, and our profitability and gross margins may be harmed or affected. Our Framework subscription model was introduced in fiscal 2020 and as such we do not have historical renewal data to rely on to help us predict our future renewal rates and we will not have relevant renewal data for a number of years.  Cancellation or deferral of purchases of our products or final customer acceptance could cause a substantial variation in our operating results, resulting in a decrease in the market price of our common stock and making period-to-period comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.  We have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from purchase orders that have exceeded one million dollars in value. A significant cancellation or deferral of purchases of our products or receiving final customer acceptance could result in a substantial variation in our operating results in any particular quarter due to the resulting decrease in revenue and gross margin. In addition, to the extent significant sales occur earlier than expected, operating results for subsequent quarters may be adversely affected because our operating costs and expenses are based, in part, on our expectations of future revenue, and we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any revenue shortfall. Because of these factors, in some future quarter our operating results may be below guidance that we may issue or the expectations of public market analysts and investors, either of which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, these factors may make period-to-period comparisons of our operating results less meaningful.  Adoption of our value based selling approach for our products and services may adversely impact our revenues and operating results.  In February 2019, we began providing our products and services to customers on the basis of our value based selling approach, under which customers would license our products and services. If we do not correctly understand the magnitude of expenses we will incur in connection with these new agreements, our operating results would be  materially affected. In addition, our revenues may be adversely affected if the new approach results in a delay in our ability to recognize revenue, in which case our revenues and operating results would be materially affected.  Due to the lengthy sales cycle involved in the sale of our products, our quarterly results may vary and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.  Our software products and related services are relatively complex and their purchase generally involves a significant commitment of capital, with attendant delays frequently associated with large capital expenditures and implementation procedures within an organization. Moreover, the purchase of these products typically requires coordination and agreement among a potential customers corporate headquarters and its regional and local operations. For these and other reasons, the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our software products and services is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks, including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews, over which we have little or no control. Based upon all of the foregoing, we believe that our quarterly revenue and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future, that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance.  If there were a decline in demand or average selling prices for our products and services, our revenue and operating results would be materially affected.  A decline in demand or average selling prices for our products or services in the foreseeable future, whether as a result of new product introductions by others, price competition, technological change, inability to enhance the products in a timely fashion, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increasingly, we are seeing competition from integrated end-to-end solutions and a large number of OTT players, each of which may reduce the demand for or average selling prices of our products and services and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.  While firm fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenue. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we will recognize a loss, which can significantly affect our reported results. The long-term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenue on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, our related margin could be reduced. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.  Our products are subject to warranty claims.  We sell our products with warranties as to the products performance in accordance with standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. There can be no assurance that the provision in our financial statements for estimated product warranty expense will be sufficient. We cannot ensure you that our efforts to reduce our risk through warranty disclaimers will effectively limit our liability. Any significant occurrence of warranty expense in excess of estimates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Further, we provide maintenance support to our customers and allocate a portion of the product purchase price to the initial warranty period and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over that warranty period related to both the warranty obligation and the maintenance support agreement. We cannot be sure that the cost of such maintenance support will be adequately provided for in our financial statements and any additional maintenance expenses could likewise have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flow.  If our software products contain serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.  Complex software applications such as ours often contain errors or defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. Despite internal testing and testing by our customers, our current and future products may contain serious defects, which could result in lost revenue, lost customers, slower growth or a delay in market acceptance.  Since our customers use our products for critical business applications, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our customers. These errors and defects could result in product liability, services level agreement claims or warranty claims. Although our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims, including warranty disclaimers, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations. Even if not successful, a claim brought against us would likely be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to sell our products and or collect payment from our customers.  We have experienced turnover in our senior management, which could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and could hinder the execution of our growth strategy.  We have recently experienced turnover in our senior management. Mr. Yossi Aloni resigned as Chief Executive Officer  CEO  in January 2021 upon which Mr. Robert Pons was appointed Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Aloni had been appointed as CEO and President in August of 2019. Chad Hassler, our Chief Commercial Officer, also resigned in January 2021. Further, the longest serving member of our board was elected in 2019. Lack of management continuity could harm our customer relationships, delay product development processes, adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy, result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, and could impede our ability to recruit new talented individuals to senior management positions, which could adversely impact our results of operations, stock price and customer relationships. Our success largely depends on our ability to integrate any new senior management within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key positions may affect our financial performance and results of operations as new members of management become familiar with our business.  Restructuring programs could have a material negative impact on our business.  To increase strategic focus and operational efficiency we have implemented restructuring programs. In fiscal 2019, we implemented a cost restructuring program, the primary element of which was staff reductions across all of our functions and geographic areas. In fiscal 2020, we continued to streamline our operations and closed our service organizations in Ireland and the Netherlands for which we realized annualized costs savings of  6.0 million. In fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic for which we expect additional annualized cost savings of  7.6 million. We also transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in fiscal 2021 in an effort to further reduce cost. As a result of these restructuring efforts, our total number of employees significantly decreased. We may incur additional restructuring costs or not realize the expected benefits of these new initiatives. Further, we could experience delays, business disruptions, decreased productivity, unanticipated employee turnover and increased litigation-related costs in connection with past and future restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of the savings achievable by restructuring will be realized. As a result, our restructuring and our related cost reduction activities could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  Actions that may be taken by significant stockholders may divert the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management from our business operations.  Campaigns by significant investors to effect changes at publicly-traded companies continue to be prevalent. There can be no assurance that one or more current or future stockholders will not pursue actions to effect changes in our management and strategic direction, including through the solicitation of proxies from our stockholders. If a proxy contest were to be pursued by a stockholder, it could result in substantial expense to us, consume significant attention of our management and Board of Directors, and disrupt our business. On February 28, 2019, we entered into the Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, we appointed both Robert Pons and Jeffrey Tuder to our Board. Certain of our significant stockholders expressed disagreement with the Cooperation Agreement and it is possible that some of our stockholders may conduct a vote no campaign against the election of all or certain of our board members standing for election at our upcoming annual meeting of  stockholders and cause the Board to consider the resignation of any candidate who does not achieve the support of a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election. Similar to a proxy contest, this could result in substantial expense to us, consume significant attention of our management and Board of Directors, and disrupt our business.  If our indefinite-lived or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.  Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on projections of future operating performance. We operate in highly competitive environments and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary materially from actual results. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge to our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a result of our impairment testing of our goodwill and other long-lived assets during the period in which any impairment of our indefinite-lived assets or other long-lived assets is determined.  The recent COVID-19 outbreak may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  The U.S. and other countries are experiencing outbreaks of COVID-19, which is continuing to spread to other countries, including countries in which we, our customers and our suppliers do business. Governments in affected regions have implemented and may continue to implement safety precautions, including quarantines, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings and other measures. Other organizations and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas. We continue to monitor our operations and government recommendations and have made appropriate modifications to our operations because of COVID-19, including substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These decisions may delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. The cancellation of major industry events in the region reduces our ability to meet with existing and potential new customers. Our customers businesses could be disrupted or they could seek to limit spending, either of which could foreclose future business opportunities, could negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us and ultimately could adversely affect our revenues. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the payment of accounts receivable and collections. Although we are unable to predict the precise impact of COVID-19 on our business, our mobile communications business in particular depends to a large extent on travel and the willingness of customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. We anticipate that, unless the outbreak is swiftly contained, governmental, individual, business and other organizational measures to limit the spread of the virus will adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. This or any other outbreak and any additional preventative or protective actions that may be taken in response to this or any other global health threat or pandemic may result in additional business and or operational disruption.  Additionally, global economic disruptions like COVID-19 could negatively impact our supply chain and cause delays in the delivery of raw materials, components and other supplies that we need to conduct our operations. We may be unable to locate replacement materials, components or other supplies, and ongoing delays could reduce sales and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the speed of contagion, the development and implementation of effective preventative measures and possible treatments, the scope of governmental and other restrictions on travel and other activity, and public reactions to these factors.  Risks Related to our Dependence on Third-Parties  If we are not able to obtain necessary licenses, services or distribution rights for third-party technology at acceptable prices, or at all, our products could become obsolete or we may not be able to deliver certain product offerings.  We have incorporated third-party licensed technology into our current products and our product lines. From time to time, we may be required to license additional technology or obtain services from third-parties to develop new  products or product enhancements or to provide specific solutions. Third-party providers may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. The inability to maintain or re-license any third-party products required in our current products or to obtain any new third-party licenses and services necessary to develop new products and product enhancements or provide specific solutions could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost. Such inabilities could delay or prevent us from making these products or services, which could seriously harm the competitiveness of our solutions.  A portion of the technology licensed by us incorporates open source software, and we may incorporate open source software in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Although we monitor our use of open source closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, if we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our services that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or alterations under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our services that contain the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services. We could also be required to seek licenses from third-parties to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely or successful basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities or our enterprise cloud computing providers could impair the delivery of our service, adversely affect our financial results and otherwise harm our business.  We use third-party data center hosting facilities for customers buying our SaaS product offering, and we use enterprise cloud computing providers in connection with certain other aspects of our business, including cloud-based data processing, storage and other services. In the case of data center hosting facilities, while we control the actual computer and storage systems upon which our software runs, and deploy them to the data center hosting facilities, we do not control the operation or availability of these facilities. We similarly do not have control over the operation or availability of enterprise cloud computing providers that we use. Any changes in third-party service levels at these facilities or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems at or related to these facilities that affect our services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Even with the disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted.  Our products are often integrated with other third-party products. Third-party delays could adversely affect our future financial operating results.  We sell our products in accordance with our standard product specifications. There can be instances where our products are integrated into a larger solution with other third-party products, the delivery of which is controlled by third party providers. We have little, if any, control over the timing of delivery of third-party products, and a delay from the time of our product delivery to the production launch of the larger solution can materially impact our financial operating results.  Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our third-party vendors.  We rely on other companies to provide products and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our third-party vendors experience delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, if one or more of the products which we depend on becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Any service disruption from one of these third-party vendors, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control or because of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.  Because we purchase certain components used in assembling some of our products from sole suppliers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by a failure of these suppliers to provide these components.  We rely on a limited number of third-parties who provide certain components used in our products. We may experience quality control problems, where products did not meet specifications or were damaged in shipping, and delays in the receipt of these components. These risks could be heightened during a substantial economic slowdown or if a sole supplier were adversely affected by a natural disaster because our suppliers are more likely to experience adverse changes in their financial condition and operations during such a period. While we believe that there are alternative suppliers available for these components, we believe that the procurement of these components from alternative suppliers could take a significant amount of time. In addition, these alternative components may not be functionally equivalent or may not be available on a timely basis or on similar terms. The inability to obtain sufficient key components as required, or to develop alternative sources if and as required in the future, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While to date there has been suitable component capacity readily available at acceptable quality levels, in the future there may not be suppliers that can meet our future volume or quality requirements at a price that is favorable to us. Any financial, operational, production or quality assurance difficulties experienced by these suppliers that result in a reduction or interruption in supply to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.  Our revenue is difficult to forecast, and as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. We use a pipeline system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. Our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals and estimate when a customer will make a purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale. These estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline. Our pipeline estimates can prove to be unreliable both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time, in part because the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contracts can be very difficult to estimate. A reduction in the conversion rate, or in the pipeline itself, could cause us to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or results of operations. In particular, a slowdown in capital spending or economic conditions generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular periods as purchasing decisions are delayed, reduced in amounts or cancelled. The conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms, which can also impede our ability to negotiate, execute and deliver upon these contracts in a timely manner.  In addition to the other risks described in this Risk Factors section, the following risks could cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results     our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;    the rates at which our customers renew;    the amount of revenue generated from our customers use of our products or services in excess of their committed contractual entitlements;    the timing and amount of costs of new and existing sales and marketing efforts;    the timing and amount of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure; and    the cost and timing of the development and introduction of new product and service offerings by us or our competitors.  Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short-term, revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large new software licenses transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly revenue and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions.  A disruption to our information technology systems could significantly impact our operations and impact our revenue and profitability.  Our data processing and financial reporting systems are cloud-based and hosted by a third-party. An interruption to the third-party systems or in the infrastructure that allows us to connect to the third-party systems for an extended period may impact our ability to operate the business and process transactions which could result in a decline in sales and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. It may also result in our inability to comply with SEC regulations in a timely manner. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced a ransomware attack on our information technology system. While such attack did not have a material adverse effect on our business operation, it caused a temporary disruption.  Risks Related to Our Industry  We operate in a relatively new and rapidly developing market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.  The market for our products and services is relatively new and rapidly developing, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including those related to     market acceptance of our current and future products and services;    customer renewal rates;    our ability to compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the market for our products;    our ability to successfully expand our business, especially internationally;    our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;    the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenses, related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;    network outages or security breaches and any associated expenses;    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;    write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities in connection with acquisitions;    our ability to successfully manage acquisitions; and    general economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.  If we do not manage these risks successfully, our business will be harmed.  If we fail to develop and consistently deliver innovative technologies and services in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries, our business could decline.  The markets for our products, services and technologies is characterized by rapid change and technological evolution. We will need to continue to expend considerable resources on research and development in the future in order to continue to design and deliver enduring, innovative entertainment products, services and technologies. Despite our efforts, we may not be able to consistently develop and effectively market new products, technologies and services that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace. In addition, we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities. Our future success depends to a great extent on our ability to develop and consistently deliver innovative technologies that are widely adopted in response to changes in the technology and entertainment industries and that are compatible with the technologies, services or products introduced by other entertainment industry participants.  Despite our efforts and investments in developing new products, services and technologies     we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all;    we cannot assure you that the level of funding and significant resources we are committing for investments in new products, services and technologies will be sufficient or result in successful new products, services or technologies;    we cannot assure you that our newly developed products, services or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property of others;    we cannot assure you that any new products or services that we develop will achieve market acceptance;    our products, services and technologies may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences;    we cannot assure you that revenue from new products, services or technologies will offset any decline in revenue from our products, services and technologies which may become obsolete; and    our competitors and or potential customers may develop products, services or technologies similar to those developed by us, resulting in a reduction in the potential demand for our newly developed products, services or technologies.  Our failure to successfully develop new and improved products, services and technologies, including as a result of any of the risks described above, may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.  Our future success is dependent on the manner in which the multiscreen video and OTT markets develop, and if these markets develop in a manner that does not facilitate inclusion of our products and services, our business may not continue to grow.  A large portion of our anticipated revenue growth is expected to come from sales and services related to our multiscreen video and OTT products. These markets continue to develop as commercial markets, both within and outside North America. In addition to the potential size of these markets and the timing of their development being uncertain, so too is the technological manner in which they will develop. The success of these markets will require that video service providers continue to upgrade their cable networks to service and successfully market multiscreen video, OTT and similar services to their cable television subscribers in a manner that permits inclusion of our products and services. If cable system operators and telecommunications companies fail to make the capital expenditures necessary to upgrade their networks or determine that broad deployment of multiscreen video and OTT services is not viable as a business proposition or if our products cannot support a substantial number of subscribers while maintaining a high level of performance, our revenue will not grow as we have planned.  If content providers limit the scope of content licensed for use in the digital VOD and OTT market, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected because the potential market for our products would be more limited than we currently believe and have communicated to the financial markets.  The success of the multiscreen video market is contingent on content providers permitting their content to be licensed for use in this market. Content providers may, due to concerns regarding either or both marketing and illegal duplication of the content, limit the extent to which they provide content to their subscribers. A limitation of  content for the VOD and OTT market would indirectly limit the market for our products that are used in connection with that market.  Consolidations in the markets we serve could result in delays or reductions in purchases of products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.  The markets we serve have historically experienced, and continue to experience, the consolidation of many industry participants. For example, AT T acquired Direct TV, Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable, Altice NV acquired HOT, Suddenlink Communications and Cablevision Systems Corp., and Frontier Communications Corporation bought select assets from Verizon Communications Inc. When consolidations occur, it is possible that the acquirer will not continue using the same suppliers, possibly resulting in an immediate or future elimination of sales opportunities for us or our competitors. Even if sales are not reduced, consolidation can also result in pressure from customers for lower prices or better terms, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Consolidations also could result in delays in purchasing decisions by the affected companies prior to completion of the transaction and by the merged businesses. The purchasing decisions of the merged companies could have a material adverse effect on our business.  There is no assurance that the current cost of Internet connectivity and network access will not rise with the increasing popularity of online media services.  We rely on third-party service providers for our principal connections to the Internet and network access, and to deliver media to consumers. As demand for online media increases, there can be no assurance that Internet and network service providers will continue to price their network access services on reasonable terms. The distribution of online media requires delivery of digital content files and providers of network access and distribution may change their business models and increase their prices significantly, which could slow the widespread adoption of such services. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a reasonable price model in place to allow for the continuous distribution of digital media files. We have limited or no control over the extent to which any of these circumstances may occur, and if network access or distribution prices rise, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.  We have been and, in the future, could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could seriously harm our business and require us to incur significant legal costs to defend our intellectual property rights.  The industry in which we operate is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions, which on occasion, have resulted in significant and often protracted litigation. We have from time to time received, and may in the future receive, communications from third-parties asserting infringements on patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products or processes. We may be a party to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or because of an allegation that we infringe others intellectual property. Any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement, as many of our commercial agreements require us to defend and or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third-party with respect to our products. We have received certain claims for indemnification from customers but have not been made party to any litigation involving intellectual property infringement claims as a result. These claims and any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights. This possibility of multiple damages serves to increase the incentive for plaintiffs to bring such litigation. In addition, these lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention away from our operations. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. In addition, any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to stop selling, incorporating or using the products that use the infringed intellectual property or obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology, although this license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, or redesign those products that use the infringed intellectual property. If we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions, our business may be seriously harmed.  Risks Related to Regulatory Matters  The success of our business model could be influenced by changes in the regulatory environment, such as changes that either would limit capital expenditures by television, cable or telecommunications operators or reverse the trend towards deregulation in the industries in which we compete.  The telecommunications and media industries are subject to extensive regulation which may limit the growth of our business, both in the U.S. and other countries. The growth of our business internationally is dependent in part on deregulation of the telecommunications industry abroad, like that which has occurred in the U.S., and the timing and magnitude of this growth, which is uncertain. Video service providers are subject to extensive government regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and other federal, state and international regulatory agencies. These regulations could have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by video service providers and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The enactment by federal, state or international governments of new laws or regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing regulations or a reversal of the trend toward deregulation in these industries could adversely affect our customers, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Uncertainties of regulation of the Internet and data traveling over the Internet could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access to or commerce on the Internet. With more business being conducted over the Internet, there have been calls for more stringent copyright protection, tax, consumer protection, cybersecurity, data localization and content restriction laws, both in the U.S. and abroad. We could be materially, adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as net neutrality. Further, governments may regulate or restrict the sales, licensing, distribution, and export or import of certain technologies to certain countries. The adoption of regulation of Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products and services, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the enactment of new federal, state, or foreign data privacy laws and regulations could cause customers not to be able to take advantage of all the features or capabilities of our products and services, which in turn could reduce demand for certain of our products and services.  Evolving data privacy regulations, including the EUs General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , and the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA , may subject us to significant penalties.  In May 2018, the EUs GDPR came into effect, and changed how businesses can collect, use and process the personal data of EU residents. The GDPR has extraterritorial effect and imposes a mandatory duty on businesses to self-report personal data breaches to authorities, and, under certain circumstances, to affected individuals. The GDPR also grants individuals the right to erasure  commonly referred to as the right to be forgotten , which may put a burden on us to erase records upon request. Compliance with the GDPRs new requirements may increase our legal, compliance, and operational costs. Non-compliance with the GDPRs requirements can result in significant penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, expose us to legal and regulatory costs, and impair our reputation.  Other jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business, have also enacted or are considering enacting their own versions of GDPR-like data privacy legislation, which could create additional compliance challenges, heightened regulatory scrutiny, administrative burden and potentially expose us to significant penalties. For example, in June 2018, Californias legislature passed the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Any failure or perceived failure by us, our business partners, or third party service providers to comply with GDPR, CCPA, other privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, or the privacy commitments in contracts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and harm our reputation.  In addition, some countries have or are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that, if enacted, could increase the cost and complexity of offering our products, software and services or maintaining our business operations in those jurisdictions.  We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  FCPA , and our failure to comply could result in penalties that could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.  We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials to obtain or keep business. The FCPA also requires companies to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the Company. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA and similar laws in other countries can impose civil and criminal penalties for violations.  If we do not properly implement practices and controls with respect to compliance with the FCPA and similar laws, or if we fail to enforce those practices and controls properly, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and restrictions on our business activities, all of which could harm our reputation, business and financial condition.  We may have additional tax liabilities.  We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, we are subject to sales, use and similar taxes in many countries, jurisdictions and provinces, including those states in the U.S. where we maintain a physical presence or have a substantial nexus. These taxing regimes are complex. For example, in the U.S., each state and local taxing authority has its own interpretation of what constitutes a sufficient physical presence or nexus to require the collection and remittance of these taxes. Similarly, each state and local taxing authority has its own rules regarding the applicability of sales tax by customer or product type.  Risks Related to Our Acquisitions  We may not fully realize the benefits of our completed acquisitions or it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits. Future acquisitions may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.  As part of our business strategy, we have acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in new businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, augment our market coverage, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in February 2019, we acquired Xstream A S, an OTT media cloud platform provider based in Copenhagen, Denmark and Warsaw, Poland for approximately  4.6 million in cash and 541,738 shares of our common stock. Acquisitions could create risks for us, including     difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel, operations, technologies or products that may affect our ability to develop new products and services and compete in our rapidly changing marketplace due to a resulting decrease in the quality of work and innovation of our employees upon which our business is dependent;    delays in realizing, or failure to realize, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Even if we can integrate these businesses and operations successfully, we may not realize the full benefits we expect to achieve, within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. If a company we purchase does not perform as we expected, our investment could become impaired or we could discontinue the operations and our financial results could be negatively impacted;    adverse effects on the business relationships with pre-existing suppliers and customers of both companies. This may be important to our business because we sell our products to a limited number of large customers, we purchase certain components used in manufacturing our products from sole suppliers and we use a limited number of third-party manufacturers to manufacture our product; and    uncertainty among current and prospective employees regarding their future roles with our company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel.  Acquisitions or divestitures may adversely affect our financial condition.  We could acquire additional products, technologies or businesses, or enter joint venture arrangements, to complement or expand our business, or engage in divestitures. As previously noted, we acquired Xstream A S in February 2019. Negotiation of potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures and our integration or transfer of acquired or divested products, technologies or businesses, could divert managements time and resources.  As part of our strategy for growth, we may continue to explore acquisitions, divestitures, or strategic collaborations, which may not be completed or may not be ultimately beneficial to us.  Acquisitions or divestitures may pose risks to our operations, including     problems and increased costs in connection with the integration or divestiture of the personnel, operations, technologies, or products of the acquired or divested businesses;    unanticipated costs;    potential disruption of our business and the diversion of managements attention from our core business during the acquisition or divestiture process;    inability to make planned divestitures of businesses on favorable terms in a timely manner or at all;    acquired assets becoming impaired because of technical advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company; and    entering markets in which we have no, or limited, prior experience.  Additionally, in connection with any acquisitions or investments we could     issue stock that would dilute our existing stockholders ownership percentages, such as occurred in connection with our February 2019 acquisition of Xstream A S;    incur debt and assume liabilities;    record contingent liabilities estimated for potential earnouts based on achieving financial targets;    obtain financing on unfavorable terms;    incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs;    incur large expenditures related to office closures of the acquired companies, including costs relating to the termination of employees and facility and leasehold improvement charges resulting from our having to vacate the acquired companies premises; and    reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or for other purposes.  Risks Related to Our International Operations  We face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas, which, if not properly managed, could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property and increased costs due to inefficient and poor work product, which could harm our business, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.  We may, from time-to-time, outsource engineering work related to the design and development of our products, typically to save money and gain access to additional engineering resources. We have worked, and expect to work in the future, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to Poland and the Netherlands. We have limited experience in the outsourcing of engineering and other work to third-parties located  internationally that operate under different laws and regulations than those in the U.S. If we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of this engineering and other work related to our products, we could suffer the loss of valuable intellectual property, or the loss of the ability to claim such intellectual property, including patents and trade names. Additionally, instead of saving money, we could in fact incur significant additional costs because of inefficient engineering services and poor work product. As a result, our business would be harmed, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.  Because our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations, we may not be able to maintain or increase international sales of our products and services.  Approximately 69  of our total revenue was generated from sales outside the United States  U.S.  during the most recent fiscal year. Our international operations are expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our business in the foreseeable future. However, in the future we may be unable to maintain or increase international sales of our products and services. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including     difficulties in establishing and managing international distribution channels;    difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;    inability to collect accounts receivable;    difficulties in selling, servicing and supporting overseas products and services and in translating products and services into foreign languages;    the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property;    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;    multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures;    negative tax consequences such as withholding taxes and employer payroll taxes;    differences in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain employees and engage in restructuring activities;    business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social and economic instability and unrest, including risks related to terrorist activity;    changes in economic policies by foreign governments, including the imposition and potential continued expansion of economic sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union  the EU  or the Russian Federation;    the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, treaties and technical standards;    cultural differences in the conduct of business;    natural disasters and pandemics; and    growth and stability of the economy or political changes in international markets.  The impact of one or more of these international risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.  Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we often sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase local currency operating costs. In preparing our consolidated  financial statements, certain financial information is required to be translated from foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar using either the spot rate or the weighted average exchange rate. If the U.S. dollar weakens or strengthens relative to applicable local currencies, there is a risk our reported sales, operating expenses and net income could significantly fluctuate. We are not able to predict the degree of exchange rate fluctuations; nor can we estimate the effect any future fluctuations may have upon our future operations.  Risks Related to Our Common Stock  Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions, and our Board of Directors has adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement, any of which could delay or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company not approved by our Board that some stockholders may consider favorable.  Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions, and our Board of Directors recently adopted Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement with an ownership trigger threshold of 4.9 , any of which could render more difficult, or discourage a merger, tender offer, or assumption of control of the Company that is not approved by our Board of Directors. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, however, should not interfere with any merger, tender or exchange offer or other business combination approved by our Board of Directors. Nor does the rights agreement prevent our Board of Directors from considering any offer that it considers to be in the best interest of the Companys stockholders.  Our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our stock may decline. If we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our securities could be delisted.  Historically, the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile. Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial price volatility. The occurrence of any one or more of the factors noted in these risk factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline below the  1.00 Nasdaq minimum price requirement such that we become subject to delisting proceedings. Any delisting of our securities could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our securities, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, having been delisted or being subject to delisting proceedings could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private markets. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.  We use estimates in accounting for our contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.  Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenue and costs and making assumptions including, in the case of our professional services contracts, the total amount of labor required to complete a project and the complexity of the development and other technical work to be completed. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions must be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include estimated third-party vendor and contract labor costs. Penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Third-party vendors assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and margin.  Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance.  General Risk Factors  Our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third-party challenges.  Our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology that is incorporated into our products. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Although we have issued patents, we cannot assure that any additional patents will be issued or that the issued patents will not be invalidated. We also enter confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to copy or otherwise misappropriate and use our products or technology without authorization, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. We may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. If competitors are able to use our technology, our ability to compete effectively could be harmed.  We face the risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it or that it would result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.  To the extent that our existing cash and investments are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist and we were to seek additional funding, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our stockholders may incur substantial dilution from any financing that we undertake given our current stock price.  Our ability to utilize our net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain other tax attributes may be limited.  As of January 31, 2021, we had federal NOLs of  131.1 million. Federal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended  Section 382 . Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect five percent shareholders increases by more than 50  over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during an applicable testing period  typically, three years . Under Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, such corporations ability to use its pre-change NOL and tax credit carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. While no ownership change has resulted in annual limitations, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change. In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the consideration could result in an ownership change. If an ownership change occurs in the future, utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. Any limitation on our ability to use NOLs may adversely impact our financial results. In March 2019, we adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement with an ownership trigger threshold of 4.9  to assist in the preservation of our ability to use NOLs and tax credit carryforwards, which was approved by our stockholders at our last annual meeting of stockholders.  If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data or our data on our systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.  Cyber criminals and hackers may attempt to penetrate our network security, misappropriate our proprietary information or cause business interruptions. Our service involves the transmission of customers proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information or a network disruption, which may result in litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, result in the unauthorized release of customer or employee data, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation or damage our reputation, which could harm our business and operating results. Additionally, third-parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing  sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data. Because we do not control our customers and third-party technology providers, or the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing.  In addition, in the past few years, widespread ransomware attacks in the U.S. and elsewhere have affected many companies, the government and commercial computer systems, and we also experienced a ransomware attack on our information technology system during the fiscal year[, which temporarily denied customers access to our services]. While such attack did not have a material adverse effect on our business operation, it caused temporary disruptions and interfered with our operations. While we intend to implement additional measures to enhance our security protocol to protect our system, there is no guarantee that future attacks or other breakdowns or breaches in our system can be thwarted or prevented, and failure to do so may increase our cost of operations and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations. Any costs that we incur as a result of the ransomware attack or any future data security incident or breach, including costs to update our security protocols to mitigate such an incident or breach could be significant. Any future ransomware attacks, breaches or failures in our operational security systems can result in loss of data or an unauthorized disclosure of or access to confidential information and could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business operations and lead to legal liability from customers, third parties and governmental authorities, any of which could adversely impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations materially.  We may experience risks in our investments due to changes in the market, which could adversely affect the value or liquidity of our investments.  We maintain a portfolio of marketable securities in a variety of instruments, which may include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, government debt securities and corporate bonds. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks. As a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, prepared in accordance with United States  U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP , included in this Form 10-K. When reviewing the discussion, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that characterize our business. In particular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasted in forward-looking statements or implied by past results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to project or anticipate future developments in our business; we encourage you to review the discussion of forward-looking statements under Cautionary Statement for Purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, at the beginning of this report. These statements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this report  unless another date is indicated , and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements as a result of future developments. Unless otherwise specified, any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended January 31st.  Business Overview   SeaChange International, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded on July 9, 1993, is an industry leader in the delivery of multiscreen, advertising and premium OTT video management solutions headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. Our software products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video and advertising content for service providers, telecommunications companies, satellite operators, broadcasters, and other content providers. We sell our software products and services worldwide, primarily to service providers including  operators, such as Liberty Global, plc., Altice NV, Cox Communications, Inc. and Rogers Communications, Inc.; telecommunications companies, such as Verizon Communications, Inc., AT T, Inc. and Frontier Communications Corporation; satellite operators such as Dish Network Corporation; and broadcasters.  Our software products and services are designed to empower video providers to create, manage and monetize the increasingly personalized, highly engaging experiences that viewers demand. Using our products and services, we believe customers can increase revenue by offering services such as VOD programming on a variety of consumer devices, including televisions, smart phones, PCs, tablets and OTT streaming players. Our solutions enable service providers to offer other interactive television services that allow subscribers to receive personalized services and interact with their video devices, thereby enhancing their viewing experience. Our products also allow our customers to insert advertising into broadcast and VOD content.  SeaChange serves an exciting global marketplace where multiscreen viewing is increasingly required, consumer device options are evolving rapidly, and viewing habits are ever-shifting. The primary driver of our business is enabling the delivery of video content in the changing multiscreen television environment. We have expanded our capabilities, products and services to address the delivery of content to devices other than television set-top boxes, namely PCs, tablets, smart phones and OTT streaming players. We believe that our strategy of expanding into adjacent product lines will also position us to further support and maintain our existing service provider customer base. Providing our customers with more scalable software platforms enables them to further reduce their infrastructure costs, improve reliability and expand service offerings to their customers. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on new customers entering the multiscreen marketplace and increasingly serve adjacent markets. Our core technologies provide a foundation for software products and services that can be deployed in next generation video delivery systems capable of increased levels of subscriber activity across multiple devices.  We have implemented restructuring programs and cost saving initiatives during the past three years to improve operations and optimize our cost structure. In fiscal 2020, we streamlined our operations and closed our service organizations in Ireland and the Netherlands, for which we realized annualized cost savings of approximately  6.0 million. In the first half of fiscal 2021, we reduced our headcount across all departments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for which we expect approximately  7.6 million of annualized savings. Additionally, in the second  quarter of fiscal 2021 we transferred our technical support services to our Poland location in an effort to further reduce cost.  In February 2019, we acquired Xstream A S, a leading OTT media cloud platform provider with its primary operations in Warsaw, Poland. Xstream provides a managed service, OTT video solution that serves more than five million active subscribers globally. Xstreams MediaMaker video platform has enhanced the SeaChange end-to-end video framework. We have used the acquisition of Xstream to accelerate our penetration in OTT and new market segments and a fully cloud-based end-to-end video platform that operates in a hosted managed service environment.  In February 2019, we entered into a cooperation agreement  the Cooperation Agreement  with TAR Holdings LLC and Karen Singer  collectively, TAR Holdings . As of the date of the Cooperation Agreement, TAR Holdings beneficially owned approximately 20.6  of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement executed on February 28, 2019, we agreed to set the size of the Board at up to eight members, appointed Robert Pons to the Board as a Class II Director with an initial term that expired at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, and appointed Jeffrey Tuder to the Board as a Class III Director with an initial term that expired at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Messrs. Pons and Tuder were subsequently re-elected in the 2019 and 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, respectively. On January 8, 2021, our Chief Executive Officer resigned, and Mr. Pons was subsequently appointed Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer in the interim.  In March 2019, our Board approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan  the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan  to deter acquisitions of our common stock that would potentially limit our ability to use NOLs to reduce our potential future federal income tax obligations. In connection with the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of March 15, 2019 to our stockholders of record on that date. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.  In February 2021, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which registered an indeterminate number of Securities using a shelf registration or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of  200 million. The shelf registration was declared effective on March 16, 2021.  In connection with the shelf registration statement, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. on March 30, 2021, to issue and sell 10,323,484 shares of common stock,  0.01 par value per share, at a public offering price of  1.85 per share  the Offering . The Offering closed on April 1, 2021 and resulted in approximately  17.6 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5 , or  0.12025 per share of common stock, and estimated offering expenses of approximately  0.2 million. In addition to the Offering, the Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,548,522 shares of common stock at a purchase price of  1.85 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.  In March 2021, we entered into a Sublease Termination Agreement  the Termination Agreement  to our current headquarters office lease at 500 Totten Pond Road, Waltham, Massachusetts that provides for an early termination of such sublease effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease the Company will pay the sublandlord a termination payment of approximately  430 thousand against an obligation of approximately  2.8 million. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025. As a result of the Termination Agreement, we expect annualized savings of approximately  600 thousand in facilities costs for each of the next four years.  Summary of Results of Operations  The following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020.  Revenue and Gross Profit  The components of our total revenue and gross profit are described in the following table   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  Change         Amounts in thousands, except for percentage data   Revenue   Product revenue   Framework     1,765     33,199      31,434      94.7      Online video platform and other  3,370  4,197   827      19.7      Hardware  1,473  2,518   1,045      41.5      Total product revenue  6,608  39,914   33,306      83.4      Service revenue   Maintenance and support  9,755  20,188   10,433      51.7      Framework and support services  3,864  1,428  2,436  170.6     Professional services and other  1,772  5,624   3,852      68.5      Total service revenue  15,391  27,240   11,849      43.5      Total revenue  21,999  67,154   66,612      67.2      Cost of product revenue  3,556  6,179   2,623      42.5      Cost of service revenue  8,513  17,473   8,960      51.3      Total cost of revenue  12,069  23,652   11,583      49.0      Gross profit     9,930     43,502      55,029      77.2      Gross product profit margin  46.2     84.5      38.3      Gross service profit margin  44.7     35.9     8.8     Gross profit margin  45.1     64.8      19.6      International revenue accounted for 69  and 53  of total revenue in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. The increase in international sales as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, is primarily attributable to a decrease in U.S. revenue driven at a higher rate than international revenue by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Product Revenue  Product revenue includes software licenses and hardware and is included in product revenue in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Software licenses include our newer go to market Framework solution and our Legacy software. Product revenue decreased by  33.3 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic as our customers and prospective customers held off on making new technology investments and deployment decisions in favor of supporting their existing operations and infrastructure through the on-going uncertainty, resulting in lower sales. Also contributing to this decrease is the slower than anticipated migration of Legacy software customers to Framework products as our customers curbed spending and tightened budgets.  Service Revenue  Service revenue includes annual support contracts and professional services and is included in service revenue in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Service revenue decreased by  11.8 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to our shift in sales to Framework, resulting in a decrease in our legacy professional services revenue related to our individual product sales and upgrades as well as a reduction in maintenance and support revenue provided on post-warranty contracts associated with decommissioned legacy products.  Gross Profit and Margin  Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of resold third-party products and services, purchased components and subassemblies, labor and overhead, testing and implementation, and ongoing maintenance of complete systems.  Our gross profit margin decreased by 20  in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower revenue generated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the inability to proportionately lower certain fixed costs in order to maintain a higher margin. Product profit margin decreased by 38  in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 also primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue generated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Service profit margin increased by 9  in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a reduction in third-party expenses and headcount driven by the COVID-19 pandemic while still recognizing legacy revenue.  Operating Expenses  Research and Development  Research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in software development and engineering functions as well as contract labor costs, depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facility expenses. The following table provides information regarding the change in research and development expenses during the periods presented   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  Change         Amounts in thousands, except for percentage data   Research and development expenses     13,808     16,050      2,242      14.0        of total revenue  62.8     23.9     Research and development expenses decreased by  2.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a  1.3 million decrease in labor and compensation costs associated with the reduction in headcount, a  0.5 million decrease in facility expenses, and a reduction in other research and development expenditures in relation to our cost-saving efforts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Selling and Marketing  Selling and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel engaged in selling and marketing functions, as well as commissions, travel expenses, certain promotional expenses and an allocation of related facility expenses. The following table provides information regarding the change in selling and marketing expenses during the periods presented   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  Change         Amounts in thousands, except for percentage data   Selling and marketing expenses     6,420     12,179      5,759      47.3        of total revenue  29.2     18.1     Selling and marketing expenses decreased by  5.8 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a  3.5 million decrease in labor and compensation costs associated with the reduction in headcount, a  1.5 million decrease in tradeshow and travel expenses, and a reduction in other selling and marketing expenditures in relation to our cost-saving efforts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and administrative functions, as well as legal and accounting services, insurance premiums and an allocation of related facilities expenses. The following table provides information regarding the change in general and administrative expenses during the periods presented   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  Change         Amounts in thousands, except for percentage data   General and administrative expenses     9,746     15,211      5,465      35.9        of total revenue  44.3     22.7     General and administrative expenses decreased by  5.5 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a  2.2 million decrease in labor and compensation costs associated with the reduction in headcount, a  1.6 million decrease in professional fees, a  0.4 million decrease in travel expenses, and a reduction in other general expenditures in relation to our cost-saving efforts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Severance and Restructuring Costs  Severance consists of employee-related severance charges not related to a restructuring plan. Restructuring costs consist of charges related to restructuring including employee-related severance charges, remaining lease obligations and termination costs, and the disposal of equipment.  For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  Change         Amounts in thousands, except for percentage data   Severance and restructuring costs     1,477     3,523      2,046      58.1        of total revenue  6.7     5.2     Severance and restructuring costs decreased by  2.0 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020, we closed our service organizations in Ireland and the Netherlands for which we realized  6.0 million in annualized cost savings. The severance costs in fiscal 2021 were primarily related to the reduction in headcount driven by the COVID-19 pandemic for which we expect approximately  7.6 million of annualized cost savings.  Loss on Sale of Fixed Assets  In December 2019, the Company sold its corporate headquarters in Acton, MA for  0.5 million, net of disposal costs. At the time of the sale, the Company disposed of all building and land related assets as well as non-building related assets. The net book value of all assets disposed of was  5.9 million. We recorded a net loss on the sale of the fixed assets of  5.4 million in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in fiscal 2020.  Other  Expense  Income, Net  The table below provides detail regarding our other  expense  income, net   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,  Change         Amounts in thousands, except for percentage data   Gain on sale of investment in affiliate     -     1,495      1,495      100.0      Interest income, net  25.8     Foreign exchange loss, net   793      2,126     1,333   62.7      Miscellaneous income, net   122      43.4          180            191     Gain on Sale of Investment in Affiliate  In connection with the sale of our investment in Layer3 TV, Inc.  Layer 3 , a company in which we had a cost-method investment, we received  4.6 million in fiscal 2018. We were entitled to additional payments of up to  2.1 million, subject to satisfaction of provisions associated with the transaction, of which we received  0.2 million in fiscal 2019. We recorded a gain on sale of investment in affiliate of  0.2 million in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in fiscal 2019 related to this payment. We received our final Layer3 payment of  1.8 million in fiscal 2020, which was partially offset by a  0.3 million loss on an unrelated investment. We recorded a net gain on sale of investment in affiliate of  1.5 million in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in fiscal 2020.  Foreign Exchange Loss, Net  Foreign exchange loss, net, was  0.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to  2.1 million in fiscal 2020. Our foreign exchange loss, net, is primarily due to the revaluation of intercompany notes.  Income Tax Provision  We recorded an income tax expense of  0.1 million and less than  0.1 million in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Our tax expense was largely driven by foreign withholding taxes. Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 and in future periods may fluctuate, as a result of changes in our jurisdictional forecasts where losses cannot be benefitted due to the existence of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, changes in actual results versus our estimates, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof.  Use of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures  We define non-GAAP  loss  income from operations as U.S. GAAP net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, non-operating expense professional fees, severance and other restructuring costs, loss on the sale of fixed assets, other  expense  income, net, and income tax provision. We discuss non-GAAP  loss  income from operations in our quarterly earnings releases and certain other communications, as we believe non-GAAP  loss  income from operations is an important measure that is not calculated according to U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP  loss  income from operations in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that the non-GAAP  loss  income from operations financial measure assists in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage the business, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. We believe that the non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making.  Non-GAAP  loss  income from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the financial adjustments described above in arriving at non-GAAP income  loss  from operations and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.  The following table includes the reconciliations of our U.S. GAAP net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to our non-GAAP  loss  income from operations for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,   Amounts in thousands   GAAP net loss      21,759         8,921     Other  expense  income, net   180     Income tax provision   58      48     GAAP loss from operations      21,521         8,884     Amortization of intangible assets  1,210  1,163  Stock-based compensation  1,247  1,151  Professional fees - other  -  1,180  Severance and other restructuring costs  1,477  3,523  Loss on sale of fixed assets  -  5,423  Non-GAAP  loss  income from operations      17,587        3,556  Non-GAAP  loss  income from operations, basic per share   0.47     0.10  Non-GAAP  loss  income from operations, diluted per share   0.47     0.10  Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic per share  37,471  36,699  Weighted average common shares outstanding, diluted per share  37,471  37,335  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table includes key line items of our consolidated statements of cash flows   For the Fiscal Years Ended January 31,   Amounts in thousands   Net cash used in operating activities      9,355         14,794     Net cash provided by investing activities  4,027  3,762  Net cash provided by financing activities  2,470  Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents  and restricted cash   355      460     Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash      3,213         11,020     Historically, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with our cash and investments. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled  6.3 million at January 31, 2021.  In fiscal 2020, we incurred  3.4 million in restructuring charges, which was inclusive of  2.1 million of charges in connection with closing our Ireland and Netherlands service organizations, for which we realized annualized cost savings of  6.0 million. In fiscal 2021, we incurred  1.5 million in severance charges, including  1.1 million of expense in relation to the reduction in headcount driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, for which we expect approximately  7.6 million in annualized cost savings.  We believe that existing cash and investments and cash expected to be provided by future operating and investing activities, augmented by the plans highlighted above, are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months.  If our expectations are incorrect, we may need to raise additional funds to fund our operations, to take advantage of unanticipated strategic opportunities or to strengthen our financial position. In the future, we may enter into other arrangements for potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to follow through with our operational plans, take advantage of market opportunities to develop new products or to otherwise respond to competitive pressures, or invest in complementary businesses or technologies.  On February 5, 2021, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which registered an indeterminate number of Securities using a shelf registration or continuous offering process. Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, sell any combination of the securities in one or more offerings up to a total aggregate offering price of  200 million. The shelf registration was declared effective on March 16, 2021.  In connection with the shelf registration statement, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Aegis Capital Corp. on March 30, 2021, to issue and sell 10,323,484 shares of common stock,  0.01 par value per share, at a public offering price of  1.85 per share  the Offering . The Offering closed on April 1, 2021 and resulted in approximately  17.6 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 6.5 , or  0.12025 per share of common stock, and estimated offering expenses of approximately  0.2 million. In addition to the Offering, the Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,548,522 shares of common stock at a purchase price of  1.85 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions.  In March 2021, we entered into the Termination Agreement to our current headquarters office lease at 500 Totten Pond Road, Waltham, Massachusetts that provides for an early termination of such sublease effective March 21, 2021. In connection with the early termination of the sublease the Company will pay the sublandlord a termination payment of approximately  430 thousand against an obligation of approximately  2.8 million. Prior to the execution of the Termination Agreement, the sublease had been scheduled to expire in February 2025. As a result of the Termination Agreement, we expect annualized savings of approximately  600 thousand in facilities costs for each of the next four years.  Net cash used in operating activities  Net cash used in operating activities was  9.4 million for fiscal 2021 and was primarily the result of our  21.8 million net loss, our operating activity non-cash adjustments, including  1.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense,  1.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, and  0.8 million in realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities, including a  6.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, a  8.0 million decrease in unbilled receivables, and a  1.2 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets partially offset by a  2.2 million decrease in accounts payable, and a  3.5 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a  0.9 million decrease in deferred revenue.  Net cash used in operating activities was  14.8 million for fiscal 2020 and was primarily the result of our  8.9 million net loss offset by a  5.4 million loss on the sale of fixed assets, a  1.5 million net gain on sale of investment in affiliate and other investments, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities, including a  17.8 million increase in unbilled receivables primarily related to Framework partially offset by a  7.1 million decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of payments and a  4.6 million decrease in deferred revenue.  Changes in accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses were generally due to timing of customer and vendor invoicing and payments as well as the timing of Framework engagements.  Net cash provided by investing activities  Net cash provided by investing activities was  4.0 million and  3.8 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2021 was due to  4.4 million in proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities partially offset by  0.3 million in purchases of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the  5.8 million of net proceeds from marketable  securities and the  1.5 million of net proceeds from the sale of investment in affiliate partially offset by  3.8 million in cash paid for the acquisition of Xstream A S.  Net cash provided by financing activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was  2.5 million and  0.5 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily from the  2.4 million proceeds from the Paycheck Protection Program  the PPP  loan. Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily from proceeds received for the issuance of common stock partially offset by repurchases of common stock.  Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic  In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, concerns related to the spread of COVID-19 began to create global business disruptions as well as disruptions in our operations and to create potential negative impacts on our revenues and other financial results. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our financial condition or results of operations is currently uncertain and depends on factors including the impact on our customers, partners, and vendors and on the operation of the global markets in general. Due to our business model, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time.  We are currently conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel, employee work locations, virtualization or cancellation of customer and employee events, and remote sales, implementation, and support activities, among other modifications. These decisions may delay or reduce sales and harm productivity and collaboration. We have observed other companies and governments making similar alterations to their normal business operations, and in general, the markets are experiencing a significant level of uncertainty at the current time. Virtualization of our teams sales activities could foreclose future business opportunities, particularly as our customers limit spending, which could negatively impact the willingness of our customers to enter into or renew contracts with us. The pandemic has impacted our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our ability to recognize revenue, and could also negatively impact the payment of accounts receivable and collections. We continue to realize our on-going cost optimization efforts in response to the impact of the pandemic. We may take further actions that alter our business operations as the situation evolves. As a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the operational alterations we have made in response on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and financial results cannot be predicted at this time.  On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act  the CARES Act . The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. We continue to examine the impact that the CARES Act may have on our business, including the extent of our PPP loan forgiveness eligibility as noted below.  The Paycheck Protection Program  On May 5, 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note  the Note  with Silicon Valley Bank  the Lender  evidencing an unsecured loan in an aggregate principal amount of  2,412,890 pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration  SBA .  Interest accrues on the Note at a fixed rate of one percent  1   per annum, with the payment of the first ten months of interest and principal deferred. The Note has an initial term of two years, is unsecured and is guaranteed by the SBA. The Company applied to the Lender for forgiveness of the Note in March 2021 with the amount which may be forgiven equal to the sum of qualifying expenses, including payroll costs, covered rent obligations, and covered utility payments incurred by the Company during the twenty-four week period beginning on May 7, 2020, calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. Management believes we have properly satisfied all eligibility requirements for full forgiveness, however, we cannot provide assurance that the loan will be forgiven.  Subject to any forgiveness under the PPP, the Note will mature on May 5, 2022. Beginning on the seventeenth-month anniversary of the date of the Note, the Company is required to make equal monthly payments of principal and interest until maturity. The Note may be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The Note provides for customary events of default including, among others, those relating to breaches of the Companys  obligations under the Note, including a failure to make payments, any bankruptcy or similar proceedings involving the Company, and certain material effects on the Companys ability to repay the Note. The Note may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.  Tax Benefits Preservation Plan  On March 4, 2019, we entered into the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in the form of a stockholder rights agreement  Rights Agreement  and issued a dividend of one preferred share purchase right  a Right  for each share of common stock payable on March 15, 2019 to the stockholders of record of such shares on that date. Each Right entitles the registered holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from us one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, par value  0.01 per share  the Preferred Shares , of the Company, at a price of  8.00 per one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share represented by a Right  the Purchase Price , subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement.  The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date  as defined in the Rights Agreement . Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.  At any time prior to ten  10  business days after the time any Person becomes an Acquiring Person  as defined in the Rights Agreement , the Board may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of  0.0001 per Right  the Redemption Price . The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board in its sole discretion may establish. Immediately upon any redemption of the Rights, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right of the holders of Rights will be to receive the Redemption Price.  The Rights will expire on the earlier of  i  the time at which the Rights are redeemed,  ii  the time at which the Rights are exchanged,  iii  the consummation of a reorganization transaction entered into by the Company resulting in stock transfer restrictions similar to the Rights Agreement,  iv  the close of business on the effective date of the repeal of Section 382  as defined in the Rights Agreement  or if the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary for the preservation of NOLs,  v  the date on which the Board determines that the Rights Agreement is no longer necessary to preserve NOLs,  vi  the beginning of the taxable year to which the Board determines that none of the NOLs may be carried forward or  vii  the close of business on March 4, 2022  the Final Expiration Date .  On June 28, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the Rights Agreement, between us and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, for the purpose of modifying the definition of Final Expiration Date to delete the extension of the Final Expiration Date in the event any person becomes an Acquiring Person  as defined in the Rights Agreement .  On August 8, 2019, we entered into an amendment No. 2 to the Rights Agreement, between us and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent, for the purpose of modifying the definition of Acquiring Person to not include TAR Holdings and their respective affiliates and associates, provided the aggregate beneficial ownership of TAR Holdings does not exceed 25.0  of the Company securities then outstanding.  Inflation Risk  During the last two years, inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business. We are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303 a  4  ii  of Regulation S-K in fiscal year 2020 or fiscal 2021.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for  making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.  The significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment     Revenue recognition     Allowance for doubtful accounts;    Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets;    Accounting for income taxes;    Accounting for stock-based compensation; and    Managements going concern assessment  Revenue Recognition  Overview   Our revenue is derived from sales of software licenses and associated third party hardware and support services, as well as professional services and support fees related to our software licenses.  The Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below     identify the customer contract;    identify performance obligations that are distinct;    determine the transaction price;    allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and    recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.  Identify the customer contract  A customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability and consideration is probable.  Identify performance obligations that are distinct  A performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a companys promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.  Determine the transaction price  The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales and VAT taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.  Allocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations  The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices  SSP  of the goods or services being provided to the customer. Our contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, for which we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct.  Recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied  We enter into contracts that include combinations of license, support, professional services, and third-party products, which are accounted for as separate performance obligations with differing revenue recognition patterns. Revenue is recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Our software licenses are primarily delivered on a perpetual basis, whereby the customer receives rights to use the software for an indefinite time period or a specified term and delivery and revenue recognition occurs at the point in time when the customer has the ability to download or access the software. Our customers may also contract with us for a Software as a Service  SaaS  type license, whereby the customer only has a right to access the software for a defined term. SaaS licenses are recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the license is made available to customers.  Our services revenue is comprised of support services and professional services. Support services consist of software upgrades on a when-and-if available basis, telephone support, bug fixes or patches and general hardware maintenance support. Revenue related to support services is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Professional services are recognized as the services are performed.  Revenues attributable to third party products typically consist of hardware and related support contracts. Hardware products are typically recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is defined as the point in time when the client can use and benefit from the hardware. In situations where the hardware is distinct and it is delivered before services are provided and is functional without services, control is transferred upon delivery or acceptance by the customer. Revenue attributable to third-party support contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.  Significant Judgments  Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once we determine the performance obligations, we determine the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on the SSP. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.  Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and the methods of estimating SSP under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  606-10-32-33. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions, expected margins, and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. In February 2019, we began selling a new software bundle called Framework in addition to our legacy software products and services. Our legacy products were historically sold on a standalone basis and therefore the SSP and revenue recognition may differ from Framework. A typical Framework deal licenses our software products and services, including upgrades for one fixed price. Management considers the pricing of our Framework perpetual licenses as highly variable and uncertain and we do not have a history of selling the Framework software on a standalone basis. We recognize the portion of the transaction price allocated to Framework software on a residual basis, as we have at least one performance obligation for which the SSP is observable. The Company notes that both hardware and support services represent observable pricing. The SSP for our Legacy software is also recognized on a residual basis, as we have observable SSP for the associated support services sold with the software license based on historical observable data of selling support contracts on a standalone basis. We may also license our software as a SaaS type license, whereby our customer only has a right to access the software over a specified time period and the service includes technical support and unspecified upgrades and bug fixes. We recognize the full value of the contract ratably over the contractual term of the SaaS license.  Our services revenue is comprised of software license implementation services, engineering services, training and reimbursable expenses. We have concluded that services are distinct performance obligations, with the exception of engineering services. Engineering services may be provided on a standalone basis or bundled with a license when providing custom development.  We utilize the cost-plus margin method to determine the SSP for our Framework support services offerings and hardware sales. For Framework support services, we calculate the average cost of support to within a small range to arrive at an average expected cost. Legacy support services are priced as a percentage of the list price of the related software license and hardware. Historically, we determined the SSP of the support services based on this pricing relationship and observable data from standalone sales of support contracts. The expected cost-plus margin for hardware is based on the cost of the hardware from third parties, plus a reasonable markup that the Company believes is reflective of a market-based reseller margin.  The SSP for services in time and materials contracts is determined by observable prices in standalone services arrangements. We estimate the SSP for fixed price services based on estimated hours adjusted for historical experience at time and material rates charged in standalone services arrangements. Revenue for fixed price services is recognized over time as the services are provided based on an input measure of hours incurred to total estimated hours.  Some of our contracts have payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, which requires us to assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one-year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. We estimate the significant financing component provided to our customers with extended payment terms by determining the present value of the future payments by applying an average standard industry discount rate that reflects the customers creditworthiness.  Payment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Our agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.  We occasionally enter into amendments to previously executed contracts that may constitute contract modifications. The amendments are assessed to determine if  1  the additional products and services are distinct from the product and services in the original arrangement; and  2  the amount of consideration expected for the added products and services reflects the SSP of those products and services. A contract modification meeting both criteria is accounted for as a separate contract. An amendment or contract modification not meeting both criteria is considered a change to the original contract and is accounted for on either a prospective basis as a termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new contract or a cumulative catch-up basis.  Contract Balances  Contract assets consist of unbilled revenue, which is recognized as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Unbilled receivables expected to be billed and collected within one year are classified as current assets or long-term assets if expected to be billed and collected after one year.  Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract  We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that commissions and special incentive payments  Spiffs  for hardware and software maintenance and support and professional services paid under our sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized under ASC 340-40. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized as selling and marketing expense over the expected period of benefit in a manner that is consistent with the transfer of the related goods or services to which the asset relates. The judgments made in determining the amount of costs incurred include whether the commissions are in fact incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract and the estimate of the amortization period. The commissions and Spiffs related to professional services are amortized over time as work is completed. The commissions and Spiffs for hardware and software maintenance are amortized over the life of the contract. These costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. We determined that no impairment of these assets existed as of January 31, 2021 or 2020. We have elected to apply the practical expedient and recognize the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.  Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  We evaluate our customers financial condition, require advance payments from certain of our customers and maintain reserves for potential credit losses. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition but generally do not require collateral. For some international customers, we may require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted. We monitor payments from customers and assess any collection issues. We maintain an allowance for specific doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We base our general allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write-off experience, current trends, credit assessments, and other analysis of specific customer situations. We charge off trade accounts receivables against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Recoveries of trade receivables previously charged off are recorded when received.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  We record goodwill when consideration paid in a business acquisition exceeds the value of the net assets acquired. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at that time but such estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events or circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.  Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting the goodwill impairment assessment. A goodwill impairment is recorded if the amount by which our carrying value exceeds our fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Factors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as a significant reduction in projected revenues, a deterioration of projected  financial performance, future acquisitions and or mergers, and a decline in our market value as a result of a significant decline in our stock price.  Intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern of consumption of the economic benefits or, if that pattern cannot be readily determined, on a straight-line basis.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. Determining the fair value of long-lived assets includes significant judgment by management, and different judgments could yield different results.  We assess the useful lives and possible impairment of existing recognized long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. We test intangible assets with definite lives for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its net undiscounted cash flows, then an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We use a discounted cash flow approach or other methods, if appropriate, to assess fair value. Factors considered important which could trigger a review include     significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;    significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;    identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit;    significant negative industry or economic trends;    a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and    a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value.  Determining whether a triggering event has occurred involves significant judgment.  Income Taxes  Income taxes comprise current and deferred income tax. Income taxes are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in other comprehensive loss. Income taxes payable, which is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets, is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially-enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the balance sheet method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences  the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially-enacted by the reporting date.  A deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.  We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable, but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly.  Our policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as a component of income tax provision  benefit , in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. We have made a policy election to treat the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income  GILTI  tax as a period expense.  Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.  Stock-Based Compensation  We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions, commencing when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. We apply the graded-vesting method to awards with market conditions that include graded-vesting features."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our Business  We are developing products and services around our patented polymorphic encryption technology, which is designed to enable secure and private data transmission. Through a licensing program, we are offering our Polymorphic Encryption Core, or PEC, which we believe to be the first secure commercially viable, advanced polymorphic data-in-motion product that is designed to be used in any commercial data security industry or in sensitive applications. To supplement our potential licensing revenue, we are building our own applications that leverage our PEC. We believe that our innovative and patented polymorphic technology provides resistant and performant solutions to the problem of quantum cracking through rapid deployment of our quantum encryption algorithm, which has been approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  We anticipate that our operating expenses for the next twelve months will require between  2.5 and  3.5 million of cash, which will come from the net proceeds we received from a private placement of our securities held between March 31, 2021 and April 16, 2021. We intend to manage our business such that our current cash reserves will allow us to reach positive cash flow from our operations, but we cannot assure you that will occur. Our proposed approach to managing our cash will initially emphasize demonstrating our products capabilities with our current customers. We will follow those efforts with using our remaining cash to scale all of our functional areas, including product development, marketing, sales, customer support, and administration.  We intend to focus our product development efforts on building new software and services to work with our existing core technology, while continuing to support our existing licensees. These efforts will require more personnel, as well as more infrastructure. We expect the increase in product development activities will require approximately  1.0 million of our cash over the next 12 months. We plan to build the infrastructure we need to perform these new functions on modern technology, with scale and reliability. We plan to utilize cloud services to provide our customers with an interface that modern software provides, but also an ease of use that we believe encryption technologies desperately need. We believe that, if we are able to build our infrastructure, as described above, we will have a competitive advantage over most other participants in our market.  We intend to have our sales and marketing efforts emphasize qualified lead generation, using very focused industry messaging and engagement. We plan to participate in relevant cybersecurity and quantum computing industry events. We have also formed a board of advisors designed to help us identify the correct product focus areas and market segmentation. This board of advisors includes professionals from cybersecurity, technology business development and software marketing. We estimate that the expenses we will incur for sales and marketing during the next fiscal year will range between  500,000 and  750,000.  Our administration costs are currently minimal. However, we expect that we will have to increase these costs if we are able to generate sufficient revenues and hire additional employees. Our administrative resources will have to be increased according to our demand to support our employees, increase accounting capacities, and expand our reporting and compliance capabilities. We expect that we will need additional personnel in our accounting and human resources functions to support these expected staff additions. We also plan to add software tools to help us manage our internal processes.  We expect that we will need to add customer support teams if and when potential customers adopt each of our product offerings. We project the costs of customer support for our fiscal year 2022 will likely range from  100,000 to  300,000. We believe that these funds will be used primarily for salaries and technology to support these efforts. These expenses will be included in our cost of goods sold.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America  GAAP . The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions.  The methods, estimates, and judgment we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based upon this definition, our most critical estimates are accounting for software revenue recognition, and stock issued to employees and non-employees. Our most critical accounting policies applicable to the periods presented are noted below. For additional information see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available, and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, deferred income taxes, accounting for share-based payments, and litigation.  Revenue Recognition. We adopted the new accounting revenue standard for revenue recognition, effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of October 1, 2018. We present our results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 under this new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under previous revenue guidance. See Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.  Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Our determination whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, versus together, may require significant judgment.  Our judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price, or SSP, for each distinct performance obligation. For products and services aside from maintenance and support, we estimate SSP by adjusting the list price by historical discount percentages. SSP for software and hardware maintenance and support fees is based on the stated percentages of the fees charged for the respective products.  Our perpetual and term software licenses have significant standalone functionality, and therefore revenue allocated to these performance obligations are recognized at a point in time upon electronic delivery of the download link and the license keys. For certain arrangements, we recognize revenue based upon usage or ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our product maintenance and support services are satisfied over time, as they are stand-ready obligations throughout the support period. As a result, we defer revenues associated with maintenance services and recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the applicable contract.  We recognize revenues associated with professional services upon customer acceptance.  Accounting for Share-Based Payments. As discussed further in Note 8  Stockholders Equity  Deficit   to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on stock compensation.  We have used and expect to continue to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share-based compensation expense. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in computing the fair value of share-based compensation expense reflect our best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. We estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors. The expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise. We determine the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 110. If we had used other assumptions or estimates, the share-based compensation expense that we recorded for the years ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 could have been materially different. Furthermore, if we use different assumptions or estimates in future periods, our share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted.  Pursuant to ASC 718-20-35-7, Repurchase or Cancellation of Equity Awards, we charge to equity the amount of cash or other assets transferred  or liabilities incurred  to repurchase an equity award, to the extent that the amount paid does not exceed the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased at the repurchase date. We recognize any excess of the repurchase price over the fair value of the instruments repurchased as additional compensation cost.  Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020  Our revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 was  15,417, a decrease of  32,566 from revenue of  47,983 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our revenue recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021 was from sales that occurred during the prior fiscal year, with the revenue being recognized over the 12 months following the invoice as cash was collected from the applicable customers. We had no new sales during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, even though we were expecting sales during the period based upon information we received from our licenses. We did not record any cost of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020.  Our general and administrative expenses decreased from  4,573,673 for the year ended September 30, 2020, to  2,597,881 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily resulted from lower legal expenses of  845,228, an impairment gain related to our operating leases of  824,559, a decrease in payroll related expenses of  390,788, and decreases in various other office expenses of  139,775, such as professional fees and subscriptions, partially offset by an increase in corporate insurance of  174,558.  Our sales and marketing expenses decreased to  96,125 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from  710,595 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease in payroll expense of  323,904, a decrease in consulting of  192,650, a decrease in marketing costs of  59,301 and a decrease in travel related expenses of  38,615.  Our research and development expenses decreased to  616,746 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from  1,689,455 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in consulting expense of  771,125 and a decrease in payroll expense of  301,584.  Our total other income increased to  191,052 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from  44,332 of other expense for the year ended September 30, 2020. The income resulted from the partial forgiveness of our PPP loan. Our other expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 was the result of losses be recognized on the disposal of some of our fixed assets.  We had a net loss of  3,104,283 for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to a net loss of  6,970,072 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in our net loss was due to a significant reduction in expenses during the latter half of the year ended September 30, 2020.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2021 of  71,530,891. We expect to continue to generate operating losses until we can generate revenues sufficient to exceed our operating expenses. As of September 30, 2021, we had  5,783,994 in cash. We believe that our existing cash balances are sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months.  Cash Flows  The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Statements of Cash Flows   Year Ended September 30,  Net cash  used in  provided by   Operating activities    3,630,806      6,646,091    Investing activities   -    28,972    Financing activities   8,334,961    84,570    Operating Activities  For the year ended September 30, 2021, we used  3,630,806 in operating activities, primarily attributable to our net loss of  3,104,283 during the period and negative non-cash items of  633,649, which were partially offset by a net positive change in net operating assets and liabilities of  107,126. Our non-cash items primarily consisted of an of impairment loss of  441,597 related to an operating lease that was terminated, and forgiveness of our PPP loan of  192,502. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in prepaid and other assets of  511,408, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  618,951. We used cash during the year to pay for the cost of general and administrative, sales and marketing, and research and development activities, totaling  3,310,752.

{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this report. If any of the following risks or other risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially harmed, and the price of our common stock could decline. Our business could also be materially and adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being harmed in these risk factors will include harm to our results of operations, financial condition, reputation and future prospects.  Risk Factors Table of Contents  Risks Related to our Business and Industry  Risks Related to our Products and Operations  Risks Related to Regulatory Matters  Risks Related to Intellectual Property  Risks Related to our Debt, our Stock, and our Charter  General Risk Factors  Risks Related to our Business and Industry  We have a history of losses, have incurred significant negative cash flows in the past, and anticipate continuing losses in the future. As such, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.  We recorded a net operating loss of approximately  146.1 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, and ended the period with an accumulated deficit of approximately  591.1 million. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near future as we continue to invest in our business. During our fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, we intend to invest in sales and marketing, and in research and development, among other areas of our business, in order to compete more successfully for the business of companies that are transitioning to cloud communications and otherwise position ourselves to take advantage of long-term revenue-generating opportunities.  We expect to continue to incur losses for at least the next fiscal year and later and we will need to increase our rate of revenue growth in order to generate and sustain operating profitability in future periods. The investments we have made in fiscal 2021 and beyond may not generate the returns that we anticipate, which could adversely impact our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to grow revenue and or achieve profitability in the time period that we expect, or at all. In order to achieve profitability, we will need to manage our cost structure more efficiently, not incur significant liabilities, while continuing to grow our revenues. Despite these efforts, our revenue growth may slow, revenues may decline, or we may incur significant losses in the future due to the continuing impact of COVID-19 and any resulting downturn in general economic conditions, increasing competition  including competitive pricing pressures , decrease in the adoption or sustained use of cloud communications market, exiting lines of business, or our inability to execute on business opportunities. Given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses, we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve or maintain operating profitability in the future.  Our future operating results, including revenues, expenses, losses and profits, may vary substantially from period to period and may be difficult to predict. As a result, we may fail to meet or to exceed the expectations of market analysts or investors, which could negatively impact our stock price.  Our historical operating results have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, and a decline in our operating results could cause our stock price to fall. On an annual and a quarterly basis, there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results, some of which are outside our control. These include, but are not limited to   changes in market demand;  customer cancellations, subscription downgrades and or service credits;  changes in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;  lengthy sales cycles and or regulatory approval cycles;  new product introductions by us or our competitors;  the mix of our customer base, sales channels, and services sold;  the number of additional customers, on a net basis;  the amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees;  unforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;  continued compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements;  material security breaches or service interruptions due to cyber attacks or infrastructure failures or unavailability; and  introduction and adoption of our cloud software solutions in markets outside of the United States.  Due to these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. It is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors.  In addition, changes in regulations, accounting principles, and our interpretation of these and judgments used in applying them, could have a material effect on our results of operations. We also need to revise our business processes, systems, and controls which requires significant management attention and may negatively affect our financial reporting obligations. If any of these were to occur, the price of our common stock would likely decline significantly.  Churn in our customer base adversely impacts our revenues and requires us to spend money to retain existing customers and to capture replacement customers. If we experience further increases in customer churn in the future, our revenue growth will be further adversely impacted and our customer retention costs will increase.  Our customers may elect not to renew their subscriptions at the end of their contractual commitment. Because of churn, we must acquire new customers and sell additional 8x8 products and services to our existing customers on an ongoing basis in order to maintain our existing level of revenue. As a result, sales and marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business. Our ability to maintain and grow our revenues is adversely impacted by the rate at which our customers cancel or downgrade service. Churn reduces our revenue growth rate, and if our churn rate increases, we have to acquire even more new customers and or sell more products and services to existing customers, in order to maintain and grow our revenues. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are a meaningful component in driving our net profitability. Churn may also prevent us from increasing the price of our services in the future as well as limiting our ability to sell additional 8x8 products and services to our existing customers and we may need to renew certain customers at a lower rate, each of which would adversely impact our revenues in the future. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful at managing our existing customer churn and or our customer churn rate increases in the future, our revenue growth would decrease and our revenues may decline causing our net loss to increase.  Our rate of customer cancellations or downgrades in services may increase in future periods due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the financial condition of our customers or the general economic environment. In addition, if we are unable to maintain the quality and performance of our service whether due to a lack of feature parity or quality of service relative to the products of our competitors or due to service outages or disruptions, we could experience potentially sharp increases in customer cancellations and or downgrades or customer credits which would adversely impact our revenues.  Our success depends on our ability to acquire new customers, and to retain and sell additional services to our existing customers.  We generate revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions to our cloud communications services to our customers, which include small and mid-size businesses, mid-market and larger enterprises, government agencies and other organizations. We define a customer as the legal entity or entities to which we provide services pursuant to a single contractual arrangement. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to increase the amount of revenue we generate, and the rate at which our revenues increase, from new and existing customers.  If our sales and marketing efforts are not effective in identifying and qualifying prospective new customers, demonstrating the quality, value, features and capabilities of our solutions to those prospects, and promoting our brand generally, we may not be able to acquire new customers at the rate necessary to achieve our revenue targets. We must also continue to design, develop, offer and sell services whose quality, cost, features and capabilities compare favorably to those offered by our competitors. As our target markets mature, or as competitors introduce lower cost and or more differentiated products or services that compete or are perceived to compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers, on favorable terms, or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and growth.  In addition to acquiring new customers, we generate new revenue by selling our existing customers additional quantities of subscribed services, or subscriptions to new or upgraded services. Particularly in the case of large enterprises, we often have opportunities to expand the sale of our services within an organization after we have completed an initial sale to one part of the organization  for example, a business unit, division or department, or personnel based in a particular country or region  and the organization has qualified us as a vendor. We invest in efforts to educate and train users on the features and capabilities of our services so that they can become advocates within their organization and encourage increased adoption of our solutions. However, if existing users within an organization are dissatisfied with any aspect of our cloud services, or the technical support, training or other professional services we provide, we may face challenges in up-selling or increasing our penetration of the organization.  Intense competition for new customers and retaining existing customers  including pricing pressure  in the markets in which we compete may prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue growth, or achieving and maintaining profitability, which could materially harm our business.  The cloud communications industry is competitive and rapidly evolving. We expect the industry to be increasingly competitive in the future due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the entry into the market of new competitors or the consolidation of existing competitors. Because we offer multiple services from a single platform, we compete with businesses in several overlapping industries, including voice, video meetings, chat, team messaging, contact center and enterprise-class API solutions.  In connection with our voice, video meetings, chat, team messaging, contact center, and enterprise-class API solutions, we face competition from other cloud service providers such as RingCentral, Inc., Genesys, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., Five9, Inc., NICE inContact, and Twilio Inc., among others as well as from legacy on-premises communications equipment providers such as Avaya, Cisco, and Mitel.  We may also face competition from Internet and cloud service companies such as Alphabet Inc.  Google Voice and Google Meet , Amazon Inc., and Microsoft Corporation, some of which are well established in the communications industry while others have only recently begun to market cloud communications solutions. Some of these competitors have developed software solutions for their respective communications and or collaboration silos, such as Microsoft which is investing significantly in its Microsoft Teams unified communication and collaboration product. Any of these companies could launch a new cloud-based business communications service, expand its existing offerings to compete with features of our services, or enter into a strategic partnership with, or complete an acquisition of, one or more of our cloud communications competitors.  Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources and brand awareness, and a larger base of customers than we have. As a result, these competitors may have greater marketing credibility. They also may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. Our competitors may also offer bundled service arrangements that present a more differentiated or better integrated product and services to customers. Increased competition could require us to lower our prices, reduce our sales revenue, increase our gross losses or cause us to lose market share. Announcements, or expectations, as to the introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors or us could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products and services, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.  Given the significant price competition in the markets for our services, we may be at a disadvantage compared with those competitors who have substantially greater resources than us or may otherwise be better positioned to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure. The harm to our business may be magnified if we are unable to adjust our expenses to compensate for such shortfall, or if we determine that we need to increase our marketing and sales efforts in order to attract new customers and retain existing customers.  Failure to grow and manage our network of indirect sales channels partners could materially and adversely impact our revenues in the future.  Our future business success, particularly to attract and support larger customers and expand into international markets, depends on our indirect sales channels. These channels consist of master agents and subagents, independent software vendors   ISVs  , system integrators, value-added resellers   VARs  , and internet service providers, among others. We typically contract directly with the end customer and use these channel partners to identify, qualify and manage prospects throughout the sales cycle-although we also have arrangements with partners who purchase our services for resale to their own customers. Our future success depends upon our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with these business partners, many of whom also market and sell services of our competitors and increasing the portion of sales opportunities they refer to us. To do so, we must continue to offer services that have quality, price, features, and other elements that compare favorably to competing services, ensure our partners are adequately trained and knowledgeable about our services, and provide sufficient incentives for these partners to sell our services in preference to those of our competitors. If we are unable to persuade our existing business partners to increase their sales of our services, or to build successful partnerships with new organizations, or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in their marketing and sales efforts, we may not be able to grow our business and increase our revenues at the rate we predict, or at all, and our business may be materially, adversely affected.  As we increase sales to enterprise customers, our sales process has become more complex and resource-intensive, our average sales cycle has become longer, and we have more difficulty predicting when sales will be completed.  We currently derive a majority of our new revenue growth from sales of our cloud software solutions to mid-market and larger enterprises, and we believe that increasing our sales to these customers is the key to our future growth. Our sales cycle, which is the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale to that customer, is often lengthy and unpredictable for larger enterprise customers. Many of our prospective enterprise customers do not have prior experience with cloud-based communications and, therefore, typically spend significant time and resources evaluating our solutions before they purchase from us. Similarly, we typically spend more time and effort determining their requirements and educating these customers about the benefits and uses of our solutions. Enterprise customers also tend to demand more customizations, integrations, and additional features than smaller customers. As a result, we may be required to divert more sales and engineering resources to a smaller number of large transactions than we have in the past, which means that we will have less personnel available to support other sectors, or that we will need to hire additional personnel, which would increase our operating expenses.  It is often difficult for us to forecast when a potential enterprise sale will close, the size of the customer's initial service order and the period over which the implementation will occur, any of which may impact the amount of revenue we recognize or the timing of revenue recognition. Enterprise customers may delay their purchases from one quarter to another as they assess their budget constraints, negotiate early contract terminations with their existing providers or wait for us to develop new features. Any delay in closing, or failure to close, a large enterprise sales opportunity in a particular quarter or year could significantly harm our projected growth rates and cause the amount of new sales we book to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We also may have to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the customer's technical or implementation requirements have been met.  The market for cloud software solutions is subject to rapid technological change, and we depend on new product and service introductions in order to maintain and grow our business.  We operate in an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements, frequent introductions of new and enhanced products and services, and continuing and rapid technological advancement. To compete successfully in this emerging market, we must continue to design, develop, manufacture, and sell highly scalable new and enhanced cloud software solutions products and services that provide higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost. If we are unable to develop new products and services that address our customers' needs, to deliver our cloud software solution applications in one seamless integrated service offering that addresses our customers' needs, or to enhance and improve our products and services in a timely manner, we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market acceptance of our services.  Our ability to grow is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver communications and collaboration solution services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently, or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete.  We may have difficulty attracting or retaining senior management and other personnel with the industry experience and technical skills necessary to support our growth.  Companies in the cloud communications industry compete aggressively for top talent in all areas of business, but particularly senior management, sales and marketing, professional services, and engineering, where employees with industry experience, technical knowledge and specialized skill sets are particularly valued. Demand can be expected to increase if cloud communications continues to gain a greater share of the global communications market. Some of our competitors may respond to these competitive pressures by increasing employee compensation, paying more on average than we pay for the same position. Any such disparity in compensation could make us less attractive to candidates as a potential employer, which in turn may make it more difficult for us to hire and retain qualified employees. Training an individual who lacks prior cloud communications experience to be successful in a sales or technical role can take months or even years.  If an employee of 8x8 leaves to work for a competitor, not only are we impacted by the loss of the individual resource, but we also face the risk that the individual will share our trade secrets with the competitor in violation of their contractual and legal obligations to us. Our competitors have in the past and may in the future target their hiring efforts on a particular department, and if we lose a group of employees to a competitor over a short time period, our day-to-day operations may be impaired. While we may have remedies available to us through litigation, they would likely take significant time and expense and divert management attention from other areas of the business.  If we increase employee compensation  beyond levels that reflect customary performance-based and or cost-of-living adjustments  in response to competitive pressures, we may sustain greater operating losses than we predicted in the near term, and we may not achieve profitability within the timeframe we had expected, or at all. In addition, we may need to issue equity at increased levels, now and in the future, to attract and retain key employees and executives, including weighting a greater percentage of our employees total compensation in the form of equity as opposed to cash, which will have the adverse effect of increasing dilution for our stockholders.  Taxing authorities have asserted that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added, or similar taxes, including where similar services from competitors may not be subject to the same obligations to collect taxes from customers, and we have been and could be in the future subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which have and could adversely affect our business.  The applicability of state and local taxes, fees, surcharges or similar taxes to our services is complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation and change. In the United States, for example, we collect state and local taxes, fees and surcharges based on our understanding of the applicable laws in the relevant jurisdiction. The taxing authorities may challenge our interpretation of the laws and may assess additional taxes, penalties and interests which could have adverse effects on the results of operations and, to the extent we pass these through to our customers, demand for our services. Additionally, the applicability of sales and use, value added, or similar taxes may differ between services such as unified communication, voice, video, contact center and platform communications such that the obligations to collect taxes from customers may vary between services and between companies such that we may be obligated to collect taxes at a higher rate that other services from our competitors impacting customer demand for our services. We currently file more than 1,000 state and municipal tax returns monthly. Periodically, we have received inquiries from state and municipal taxing agencies with respect to the remittance of state or municipal taxes, fees or surcharges. Currently, several jurisdictions are conducting audits of 8x8; in the event our positions are unsuccessful, we may be subject to tax payments, interest, and penalties in excess of those that we have accrued for. As of March 31, 2021, we have accrued for state or municipal taxes, fees or surcharges that we believe are required to be remitted.  Our ability to use our net operating losses or research tax credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.  As of March 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss  NOL  carryforwards related to fiscal 2019 and later of approximately  433.0 million which carryforward indefinitely and carryforwards related to prior years of  137.8 million which begin to expire in 2022. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards  296.6 million, which expire at various dates between 2029 and 2041. We also had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and California tax purposes of approximately  15.3 million and  16.9 million, respectively. The federal income tax credit carryforwards related to research and development will expire at various dates between 2022 and 2041, while the California income tax credits will carry forward indefinitely, but are subject to an annual cap of  5 million for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and before January 1, 2023. Utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards can become subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. A Section 382 ownership change generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5  of the stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Such an ownership change, or any future ownership change, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize the net operating loss or research credit carryforwards. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, the amount of NOLs that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80  of the taxable income in such year. Under the CARES Act, this 80  limitation has been eliminated for tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. There is a risk that due to changes under the Tax Act, regulatory changes, or other unforeseen reasons, the existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our net income  loss  in future periods.  Risks Related to our Products and Operations  If our platform or services experience significant or repeated disruptions, outages or failures due to defects, bugs, vulnerabilities or similar software problems, or if we fail to determine the cause of any disruption or failure and correct it promptly, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims or incur significant costs, reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our operating results.  Our customers use our communications services to manage important aspects of their businesses, and any errors, defects, outages, or disruptions to our service or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers' businesses, any of which may result in our granting of credits to customers that in turn would reduce our revenue. Our services and the systems infrastructure underlying our cloud communications platform incorporate software that is highly technical and complex. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities to hackers, which have caused, and may in the future cause, temporary service outages or other disruptions for some customers. Some errors in our software code may not be discovered until after the code has been released. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue, or liability for service credits or damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. We implement bug fixes and upgrades as part of our regularly scheduled system maintenance, which may lead to system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any history of defects, or the loss, damage or inadvertent release of confidential customer data, could cause our reputation to be harmed, and customers may elect not to purchase or renew their agreements with us and subject us to service performance credits, warranty claims or increased insurance costs. The costs associated with any material defects or errors in our software or other performance problems may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results.  Our physical infrastructure is concentrated in a few facilities  data centers and public cloud providers  and any failure in our physical infrastructure or service outages could lead to significant costs and or disruptions and could reduce our revenue, harm our business reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  Our leased network and data centers as well as public cloud infrastructure are subject to points of failure. Problems with cooling equipment, generators, uninterruptible power supply, routers, switches, or other equipment, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions for our customers as well as equipment damage. Because our services do not require geographic proximity of our data centers to our customers, our infrastructure is consolidated into a few large data center facilities. Any failure or downtime in one of our data center facilities could affect a significant percentage of our customers. While our data center facilities are currently operating as essential businesses exempt from current shelter-in-place orders, further tightening of business closure orders or social distancing or COVID-19 outbreaks could negatively impact these facilities. The total destruction, closure, or severe impairment of any of our data center facilities could result in significant downtime of our services and the loss of customer data. Because our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our ability to provide customers with highly reliable service, even minor interruptions in our service could harm our reputation. Additionally, in connection with the expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities from time to time, there is an increased risk that service interruptions may occur as a result of server relocation or other unforeseen construction-related issues.  We have experienced interruptions in service in the past. The harm to our reputation is difficult to assess but has resulted and may result in the future in customer attrition. We have taken and continue to take steps to improve our infrastructure to prevent service interruptions, including upgrading our electrical and mechanical infrastructure. However, service interruptions continue to be a significant risk for us and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Any future service interruptions could   cause our customers to seek service credits, or damages for losses incurred;  require us to replace existing equipment or add redundant facilities;  affect our reputation as a reliable provider of communications services;  cause existing customers to cancel or elect to not renew their contracts; or  make it more difficult for us to attract new customers.  We may be required to transfer our servers to new data center facilities or public cloud load to a different public cloud provider in the event that we are unable to renew our agreement or leases on acceptable terms, or at all, or the owners of the facilities decide to close their facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy or foreclosure, faced by our third-party data center operators, or any of the service providers with which we or they contract, may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our data centers or our public cloud providers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, our ability to grow our business could be materially and adversely impacted.  We may not be able to scale our business efficiently or quickly enough to meet our customers' growing needs, leading to increased customer churn and damage to reputation and brand, each of which could harm our operating results.  As usage of our cloud software solutions by mid-market and larger enterprises expands and as customers continue to integrate our services across their enterprises, we are required to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating our products and applications across our technology platform, integrating with third-party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen increased usage of our services from our existing customers and may see further increases in usage from existing and new customers in the future if remote working trends continue to increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. To the extent we increase our customer base and as our customers gain more experience with our services, the number of users and transactions managed by our services, the amount of data transferred, processed and stored by us, the number of locations where our service is being accessed, and the volume of communications managed by our services have in some cases, and may in the future, expand rapidly. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale and modernize our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support, sales operations, billing services and regulatory, privacy and cybersecurity compliance, to serve our growing customer base. Any failure or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could adversely impact our reputation and brand, reduce the attractiveness of our cloud software solutions to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could hurt our revenue growth and our reputation.  Because our long-term growth strategy involves continued expansion outside the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.  An important component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. We have formed subsidiaries outside the United States, including a subsidiary in Romania that contributes significantly to our research and development efforts. Additionally, through acquisitions, we have expanded into the U.K. and Southeast Asia. The risks and challenges associated with sales and other operations outside the United States are different in some ways from those associated with our operations in the United States, and we have a limited history addressing those risks and meeting those challenges. Our current international operations and future initiatives, including Southeast Asia, will involve a variety of risks, including   localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;  regulation of our services as traditional telecommunications services, requiring us to obtain authorizations or licenses to operate in foreign jurisdictions, or alternatively preventing us from selling our full suite of services, or any services at all, in such jurisdictions;  changes in a specific country or region's regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, or political or economic conditions;  increased competition from regional and global cloud communications competitors in the various geographic markets in which we compete where such markets may have different sales cycles, selling processes, and feature requirements which may limit our ability to compete effectively in different regions globally;  more stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, access to, and transfer of, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union, or EU;  differing labor regulations, especially in the EU and Latin America, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;  challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;  difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;  increased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;  different pricing environments, longer sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties;  currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;  limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;  laws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;  limited or insufficient intellectual property protection;  political instability or terrorist activities;  exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, trade and export laws such as those enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control  OFAC  of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;  continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union;  regional travel restrictions, business closures and shelter-in-place orders and resulting from COVID-19; and  adverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.  We have limited experience in operating our business internationally, which increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. We expect to invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations. If we are unable to do this successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  We face risks related to acquisitions now and in the future that may divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain and grow our existing business.  Although we have acquired several small companies and business units in recent years, we have limited experience with purchasing and integrating other businesses. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future or negotiate and complete acquisitions on favorable terms.  If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may decide to acquire such companies, or their products, technologies or assets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, and there is no guarantee that we will ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve other benefits expected from the transaction. Among other risks we may encounter in connection with acquisitions   We may experience difficulty and delays in integrating the products, technology platform, operations, systems and personnel of the acquired business with our own, particularly if the acquired business is outside of our core competencies;  We may not be able to manage the acquired business, or the integration process, effectively, which may limit our ability to realize the financial and strategic benefits we expected from the transaction;  The acquisition and integration may divert managements attention from our day-to-day operations and disrupt the ordinary functioning of our ongoing business;  We may have difficulty establishing and maintaining appropriate governance, reporting relationships, policies, controls and procedures for the acquired business, particularly if it is based in a country or region where we did not previously operate;  Any failure to successfully manage the integration process may also adversely impact relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and business partners, or those of the acquired business, and may result in increased churn or the loss of key customers, business partners or employees for our business or those of the acquired business;  We may become subject to new or more stringent regulatory compliance obligations and costs by virtue of the acquisition, including risks related to international acquisitions that may operate in new jurisdictions or geographic areas where we may have no or limited experience;  We may become subject to litigation, investigations, proceedings, fines or penalties arising from or relating to the transaction or the acquired business, and any resulting liabilities may exceed our forecasts;  We may acquire businesses with different revenue models, customer concentration risks, and contractual relationships;  We may assume long-term contractual obligations, commitments or liabilities  for example, those relating to leased facilities , which could adversely impact our efforts to achieve and maintain profitability and impair our cash flow;  We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges; and  The acquisition may create a drag on our overall revenue growth rate, which could lead analysts and investors to reduce their valuation of our company.  In addition, we may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to flexibly operate our business.  As a result of these potential problems and risks, among others, businesses that we may acquire or invest in may not produce the revenue, competitive advantages, or business synergies that we anticipate, and the results and effects of any such acquisition may not be favorable enough to justify the amount of consideration we pay or the other investments we make in the acquired business.  If we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our communications and collaboration software with third-party applications and mobile platforms that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue could decline.  The functionality and popularity of our cloud software solutions depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our services with third-party applications and platforms, including enterprise resource planning, customer relations management, human capital management, workforce management, and other proprietary application suites. Third-party providers of applications and application programmable interfaces, or APIs, may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our customers ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our services, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our software with new third-party back-end enterprise applications and platforms used by our customers, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.  Our services also allow our customers to use and manage our cloud software solutions on smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. As new smart devices and operating systems are released, we may encounter difficulties supporting these devices and services, and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of our mobile applications. In addition, if we experience difficulties in the future integrating our mobile applications into smartphones, tablets or other mobile devices or if problems arise with our relationships with providers of mobile operating systems, such as those of Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc.  Google , our future growth and our results of operations could suffer.  To provide our services, we rely on third parties for our network service and connectivity and any disruption or deterioration in the quality of these services or the increase in the costs we incur from these third parties could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We rely on third-party network service providers to originate and terminate substantially all of the PSTN calls using our cloud-based services. We leverage the infrastructure of third-party network service providers to provide telephone numbers, PSTN call termination and origination services, and local number portability for our customers rather than deploying our own network throughout the United States and internationally. We use the infrastructure of third-party network service providers, such as Equinix, Inc. and CenturyLink, Inc. and public cloud providers including AWS and Oracle, to provide our cloud services over their networks rather than deploying our own network connectivity. These decisions have resulted in lower capital and operating costs for our business in the short-term, but have reduced our operating flexibility and ability to make timely service changes. If any of these network service providers cease operations or otherwise terminate the services that we depend on or become unwilling to supply cost-effective services to us in the future, the delay in switching our technology to another network service provider, if available, and qualifying this new service provider could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. In addition, the rates we pay to our network service providers and other intermediaries may also change more rapidly than we change the pricing we charge our customers, which may reduce our profitability and increase the retail price of our service.  We depend on third-party vendors for IP phones and certain software endpoints, and any delay or interruption in supply by these vendors would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business.  We rely on third-party vendors for IP phones and software endpoints required to utilize our service. We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with any of these vendors. As a result, most of these third-party vendors are not obligated to provide products or services to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. The inability of these third-party vendors to deliver IP phones of acceptable quality and in a timely manner, particularly the sole source vendors, could adversely affect our operating results or cause them to fluctuate more than anticipated. Additionally, some of our products and services may require specialized or high-performance component parts that may not be available in quantities or in time frames that meet our requirements due to COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.  Difficulty executing local number porting requests could negatively impact our business.  The FCC and foreign regulators require VoIP providers to support telephone number porting within specified timeframes. In order to port telephone numbers, we rely on third party telecommunications carriers to complete the process. Often number ports take longer than the specified timeframes. For many potential customers, the ability to quickly port their existing telephone numbers into our service in a timely fashion is a very important consideration. To the extent that we cannot quickly port telephone numbers in, our ability to acquire new customers may be negatively impacted. To the extent that we cannot quickly port telephone numbers out when a customer leaves our service to go to another provider, we could be subject to regulatory enforcement action.  Risks Related to Regulatory Matters  Vulnerabilities to security breaches, cyber intrusions and other malicious acts could adversely impact our business.  Our operations depend on our ability to protect our network from interruption by damage from hackers, social engineering and phishing, ransomware, computer viruses, worms, other malicious software programs or similar disruptive problems or other events beyond our control. In the past, we have been subject to denial or disruption of service   DDOS  , and we may be subject to DDOS attacks in the future. We cannot assure you that our backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, DDOS mitigation and other procedures that are currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure or data loss.  Inherent in our provision of service are the storage, processing, and transmission of our customers' data, which may include confidential and sensitive information. Customers may use our services to store, process and transmit a wide variety of confidential and sensitive information such as credit card, bank account and other financial information, proprietary information, trade secrets or other data that may be protected by sector-specific laws and regulations like intellectual property laws, laws addressing the protection of personally identifiable information  or personal data in the European Union , as well as the Federal Communications Commissions, or the FCCs, customer proprietary network information  CPNI  rules. We may be targets of cyber threats and security breaches, given the nature of the information we store, process and transmit and the fact that we provide communications services to a broad range of businesses.  In addition, we use third-party vendors which in some cases have access to our data and our customers' data. Despite the implementation of security measures by us or our vendors, our computing devices, infrastructure or networks, or our vendors computing devices, infrastructure or networks may be vulnerable to hackers, social engineering and phishing, ransomware, computer viruses, worms, other malicious software programs or similar disruptive problems due to a security vulnerability in our or our vendors' infrastructure or network, or our vendors, customers, employees, business partners, consultants or other internet users who attempt to invade our or our vendors' public and private computers, tablets, mobile devices, software, data networks, or voice networks. If there is a security vulnerability in our or our vendors' infrastructure or networks that is successfully targeted, we could face increased costs, liability claims, government investigations, fines, penalties or forfeitures, class action litigation, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  We could be liable for breaches of security on our website, fraudulent activities by our users, or the failure of third-party vendors to deliver credit card transaction processing services.  A fundamental requirement for operating an Internet-based, worldwide cloud software solution and electronically billing our customers is the secure transmission of confidential information and media over public networks. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches, failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may subject us to costly breach notification and other mitigation obligations, class action lawsuits, investigations, fines, forfeitures or penalties from governmental agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.  The law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled and states may enact their own rules with which we may not comply. We rely on third-party providers to process and guarantee payments made by our subscribers up to certain limits, and we may be unable to prevent our customers from fraudulently receiving goods and services. Our liability risk will increase if a larger fraction of transactions affected using our cloud-based services involve fraudulent or disputed credit card transactions.  We may also experience losses due to subscriber fraud and theft of service. Subscribers have, in the past, obtained access to our service without paying for monthly service and international toll calls by unlawfully using our authorization codes or by submitting fraudulent credit card information. If our existing anti-fraud procedures are not adequate or effective, consumer fraud and theft of service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  Failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations related to data privacy and protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  We process many types of data, including personal data in the course of our business. As such, we are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign governmental agencies, including the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation   GDPR   and the California Consumer Privacy Act   CCPA  . Data privacy and protection is highly regulated in many jurisdictions and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. For example, lawmakers and regulators worldwide are considering proposals that would require companies, like us, that encrypt users' data to ensure access to such data by law enforcement authorities. Privacy laws restrict our processing of personal information, provided to us by our customers as well as data we collect from our customers and employees. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, if we fail to comply, we may be subject to fines, penalties and lawsuits, statutory damages at both the federal and state levels in the U.S., substantial fines and penalties under the European Unions GDPR, class action lawsuits, and our reputation may suffer. We may also be required to make modifications to our data practices that could have an adverse impact on our business, including increasing our operating costs which may cause us to increase our prices making our services less competitive.  We are also subject to the privacy and data protection-related obligations in our contracts with our customers and other third parties. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data or consumer protection, or to comply with our contractual obligations related to privacy, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us, as well as harm our reputation. Additionally, third parties on which we rely enter into contracts to protect and safeguard our customers' data. Should such parties violate these agreements or suffer a breach, we could be subject to proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, contractual parties or others, which could result in significant liability to us as well as harm to our reputation.  Our products and services must comply with industry standards, FCC regulations, state, local, country-specific and international regulations, and changes may require us to modify existing services, potentially increase our costs or prices we charge customers, and otherwise harm our business.  As a provider of interconnected VoIP services, we are subject to various international, federal, state and local requirements applicable to our industry, including those that address, among other matters, acceptable marketing practices, the accessibility of 9-1-1 or other international emergency services, local number porting, robo-calling, and caller ID spoofing. The failure of our products and services to comply, or delays in compliance, with various existing and evolving standards could delay or interrupt our introduction of new products, subject us to fines or other imposed penalties, or harm our reputation, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.  Regulations to which we may be subject address the following matters, among others   license requirements that apply to providers of communications services in many jurisdictions;  our obligation to contribute to various Universal Service Fund programs, including at the state level;  monitoring on rural call completion rates;  safeguarding and use of Customer Proprietary Network Information   CPNI  ;  rules concerning access requirements for users with disabilities;  our obligation to offer 7-1-1 abbreviated dialing for access to relay services;  compliance with the requirements of U.S. and foreign law enforcement agencies, including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act   CALEA  , and cooperation with local authorities in conducting wiretaps, pen traps and other surveillance activities;  the ability to dial 9-1-1  or corresponding numbers in regions outside the U.S. , auto-locate E-911 calls  or corresponding equivalents  when required, and access emergency services;  the transmission of telephone numbers associated with calling parties between carriers and service providers like us;  regulations governing outbound dialing, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act; and  FCC and other regulators efforts to combat robo-calling and caller ID spoofing.  Regulation of our services as telecommunications services may require us to obtain authorizations or licenses to operate in foreign jurisdictions and comply with legal requirements applicable to traditional telephony providers. This regulation may impact our ability to differentiate ourselves from incumbent service providers and imposes substantial compliance costs on us. In addition, the reform of federal and state Universal Service Fund programs and payment of regulatory and other fees in international markets, could increase the cost of our service to our customers diminishing or eliminating any pricing advantage we may have.  Efforts to address robo-calling and caller ID spoofing could cause us competitive harm.  In June 2019, the FCC ruled that providers of voice services may by default  subject to opt-out by subscribers  block voice traffic based on reasonable analytics designed to identify unwanted calls. In March 2020, the FCC required that all voice service providers implement the STIR SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework in the Internet Protocol  IP  portions of their networks by June 30, 2021. There is significant uncertainty regarding how STIR SHAKEN will work. For example, there is currently no accepted standard by which voice service providers that do not have authorization to directly obtain telephone numbers will be able to authenticate calls originated by their customers. We have obtained authorization to directly obtain telephone numbers in the U.S. in order to be able to authenticate calls under STIR SHAKEN originated by our subscribers. The STIR SHAKEN framework will likely be used throughout the world. It is likely that the standards to obtain STIR SHAKEN signing authority in other countries will differ from the U.S. requirements and similar to the U.S., there are no accepted standards yet for how voice service providers that do not have direct STIR SHAKEN signing authority will be able to authenticate calls originated by their customers. In addition, foreign regulators have allowed terminating voice service providers to block voice traffic to address robo-calling or other unwanted calls. If we do not have a solution in place for STIR SHAKEN when STIR SHAKEN becomes widely adopted, our business could be harmed as we would be unable to authenticate originating calls from our subscribers telephone numbers under STIR SHAKEN. Call recipients would be less likely to answer non-authenticated calls. In addition, the terminating voice service providers may block calls that are not authenticated under STIR SHAKEN as the lack of authentication could be viewed as a reasonable indication that the call is unwanted by the recipient. This would make our service less desirable for our customers. Further if we do not have STIR SHAKEN caller ID authentication in place when required, we could be subject to regulatory enforcement action.  Risks Related to Intellectual Property  Our infringement of a third party's proprietary technology could disrupt our business.  If we are found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third-party in lawsuits or proceedings that may be asserted against us, we could be subject to monetary liabilities for such infringement, which could be material. We could also be required to refrain from using, manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Our broad range of current and former technology, including IP telephony systems, digital and analog circuits, software, and semiconductors, increases the likelihood that third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights. We have received and may continue to receive in the future, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation or misuse of other parties' proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in these discussions and actions or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third-party patents will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Furthermore, lawsuits like these may require significant time and expense to defend, may divert management's attention away from other aspects of our operations and, upon resolution, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Inability to protect our proprietary technology would disrupt our business.  We rely, in part, on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the United States and abroad. We seek to protect our software, documentation, and other written materials under trade secret and copyright law, which afford only limited protection. We currently have several United States patent applications pending. We cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents, and if they do, whether such patents will effectively protect our intellectual property. The intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage, and could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or misappropriated. We may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the United States or internationally  where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited , and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours.  Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights or the rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability.  Our inability to use software licensed from third parties, or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights, could disrupt our business.  Our technology platform incorporates software licensed from third parties, including some software, known as open source software, which we use without charge. Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our platform to our customers. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platform, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Alternatively, we may need to re-engineer our platform or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our platform. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using such software to others on unfavorable license terms. Our inability to use third-party software could result in disruptions to our business, or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings, which could impair our business.  Risks Related to our Debt, our Stock, and our Charter  Servicing our debt, including the paying down of principal, requires the use of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay down our substantial debt.  As of November 21, 2019, we had issued  362.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50  convertible senior notes due 2024 in a private placement. Pursuant to an indenture dated as of February 19, 2019 between us and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, the notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50  per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on February 1 and August 1 of each year, and they will mature on February 1, 2024, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.  Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the amounts payable under the notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including paying off the principal when due, and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.  We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes.  Holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the occurrence of the fundamental change may also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.  The conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  In the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of notes do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as our notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.  Under Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options  ASC 470-20 , an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments  such as the notes  that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component would be treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the notes. We will report larger net losses  or lower net income  in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instruments non-convertible coupon interest rate, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.  In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments  such as the notes  that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of such notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of such notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes, then our diluted earnings per share could be adversely affected.  The capped call transactions entered into in connection with our sale of notes may affect the market value of our common stock.  In connection with the offer and sale of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers or affiliates thereof and or other financial institutions  the option counterparties . The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes at maturity and or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and or offset subject to a cap.  In capped call transactions similar to the ones we entered into, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates typically enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the issuer's common stock and or purchase shares of the issuer's common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates in our capped call transactions may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes  and are likely to do so during the valuation period for the capped call transactions, which is expected to occur during the 40 trading day period beginning on the 41st scheduled trading day prior to the maturity of the notes . This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.  Future sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could lower the market price of our common stock.  In the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or equity-linked securities to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options, upon the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units and performance units, stock purchases in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Program, and upon conversion of our notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock or equity-linked securities, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities.  Certain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts.  Our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things   no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;  the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;  a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;  the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our Board of Directors or by stockholders holdings shares of our common stock representing in the aggregate a majority of votes then outstanding, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;  the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our by-laws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our by-laws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and  advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.  We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware   DGCL  . Under Section 203 of the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15  or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or  a  our board of directors approves the transaction prior to the stockholder acquiring the 15  ownership position,  b  upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder acquiring the 15  ownership position, the stockholder owns at least 85  of the outstanding voting stock  excluding shares owned by directors or officers and shares owned by certain employee stock plans  or  c  the transaction is approved by the board of directors and by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting by a vote of 66 2 3  of the outstanding voting stock  excluding shares held or controlled by the interested stockholder . These provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts.  General Risk Factors  COVID-19 and any economic difficulty it triggers could significantly harm our business.  The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses. Many of our existing and prospective customers have experienced economic hardship. This could reduce the demand for our cloud services, delay and lengthen sales cycles, increase customer churn, force us to lower the prices for our services and or provide customers with service credits, and lead to slower growth or even a decline in our revenues, operating results and cash flows. The impact of COVID-19 on demand for our services depends on numerous evolving factors including  the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the rate of vaccinations globally and the efficacy of available vaccines; the effect on our customers and customer demand and their ability to pay for our services; disruptions to third-party data centers and Internet service providers; and any decline in the quality and or availability of our services. And it It is possible that as businesses return to in-person work the demand for some of our products could decline.  The impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions has at some periods also impacted the functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Since we are not cash flow positive, depending on the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and any economic recession that it triggers, we may need to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all.  We may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.  We may need to pursue financing in the future to make expenditures or investments to support the growth of our business  whether through acquisitions or otherwise  and may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives, respond to new competitive pressures, service our debt, pay extraordinary expenses such as litigation settlements or judgments or fund growth, including through acquisitions, among other potential uses. Additional funds, however, may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.  Natural disasters, war, terrorist attacks, global pandemics or malicious conduct, among other unforeseen events, could adversely impact our operations, could degrade or impede our ability to offer services, and may negatively impact our financial condition, revenues and costs going forward.  Our cloud communications services rely on uninterrupted connection to the Internet through data centers and networks. Any interruption or disruption to our network, or the third parties on which we rely, could adversely impact our ability to provide service. Our network could be disrupted by circumstances outside of our control including natural disasters, acts of war, terrorist attacks, global pandemics or malicious acts, among other unforeseen events, including, but not limited to, cyber-attacks. For example, our headquarters, global networks operations center and one of our third-party data center facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Also, global pandemics, such as the one caused by COVID-19, may restrict travel by personnel, reduce the availability of materials required to maintain data centers that support our cloud communication services, and could require us or our partner data centers and Internet service providers to curtail operations in certain geographic regions. Such an event may also impede our customers' connections to our network, since these connections also occur over the Internet, and would be perceived by our customers as an interruption of our services, even though such interruption would be beyond our control. In addition, as a result of COVID-19, we have been experiencing changes to our normal business practices due to our employees working from home in compliance with shelter-in-place orders in many of our office locations. As we implement modifications to employee travel and employee work locations in response, among other business modifications, these changes could, in the future, negatively impact our normal provision of services, particularly in the areas of sales and marketing to new and prospective customers. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business causing us to incur significant expenses, lose substantial amounts of revenue, suffer damage to our reputation, and lose customers."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  We are a leading SaaS provider of voice, video, contact center, and communication APIs powered by a global cloud communications platform. From our proprietary cloud technology platform, organizations across all their locations and employees have access to unified communications, team collaboration, video conferencing, contact center, data and analytics, communication APIs, and other services, enabling them to be more productive and responsive to their customers.  Our customers range from small businesses to large enterprises and their users are spread across more than 150 countries. In recent years, we have increased our up-market focus on the mid-market and enterprise customer sectors.  We have a portfolio of cloud-based offerings that are subscription based, made available at different rates varying by the specific functionalities, services and number of users. We generate service revenue from communications services subscriptions and platform usage. We generate other revenue from professional services and the sale of office phones and other hardware equipment. We define a customer as one or more legal entities to which we provide services pursuant to a single contractual arrangement. In some cases, we may have multiple billing relationships with a single customer  for example, where we establish separate billing accounts for a parent company and each of its subsidiaries .  Our flagship service is our 8x8 X Series, a suite of UCaaS and CCaaS solutions, which consist of service plans of increasing functionality designated X1, X2, etc., through X8. With 8x8 X Series, we provide enterprise-grade voice, unified communications, video meetings, team collaboration, and contact center functionalities from a single platform. We also offer standalone SaaS services for contact center, video meetings, and enterprise communication APIs. Through our July 2019 acquisition of Wavecell Pte. Ltd., an Asia-based global communication platform as a service CPaaS provider of SMS, messaging, voice and video APIs to enterprises, we expanded our API offerings both geographically and in scope. We expect to continue integrating these services into our platform, as we believe in the value of the collective solutions.  Throughout fiscal 2021, the Company incurred professional services and related engineering costs to upgrade our customers to the 8x8 X Series platform. As of March 31, 2021, we have upgraded substantially all of our customers to X Series, and intend to complete remaining upgrades in fiscal 2022. While we may not be able to recover these costs from our customers, we believe that we will realize other benefits including reducing the number of platforms that we are required to support and improved customer retention.  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK  In fiscal 2021, our total service revenue grew approximately 20  year-over-year to  496.0 million. We continued to show an increase in our average annualized service revenue per customer, which grew to  8,439 in fiscal 2021, from  7,876 in fiscal 2020, as we are selling more to mid-market and enterprise customers. Annual service revenue from mid-market and enterprise customers represented 47  of total annual service revenue and grew 31  over the prior year. We also increased the number of deals where customers purchase our integrated communications and contact center solutions, which we have referred to as bundled deals, 67  of our new bookings greater than  12,000 of annualized recurring revenue were from customers that selected bundled UCaaS and CCaaS, as compared to 60  one year ago.  Our continued business focus is on achieving improved operating efficiencies while delivering revenue growth. In fiscal 2021, while we continued to make important investments in our products and technology platform, management recognized the importance of driving toward profitability for sustainable scale. We focused on key areas of spend in our go-to-market strategy and improving gross margin and operating margin through increased spend discipline. Additionally, we looked to drive improved efficiencies in our customer acquisition and operations, and focused on expanding our business upmarket with mid-market and enterprise customers. We believe that this approach will enable the Company to grow and capture market share during this phase of industry disruption, in a cost-effective way, and support the Company in pursuit of its path to profitability and operating cashflow improvement.  In prior years, we made strategic investments in R D and marketing, which we considered necessary and important for delivering a robust platform to our customers and establishing the appropriate demand generation channels to connect our customers to our solutions. In fiscal 2019, we launched 8x8 X Series, our single-technology platform, and re-aligned our channel and marketing functions to support a more scalable, higher-growth, go-to-market strategy, in response to the shift of businesses from legacy on-premise communication solutions to cloud-based services. We believe that this industry trend continued throughout our fiscal 2021. Accordingly, we continued to invest in our business, but with a concurrent focus on scale and managing costs with the goal of driving to profitability.  In fiscal 2022, we plan to continue making investments in activities to acquire more customers, including investing in our marketing efforts, internal and field sales capacity, and research and development. We also intend to continue investing in our indirect channel programs to acquire more third-party selling agents to help sell our solutions, including VARs and master agent programs.  NEW CEO APPOINTMENT  On December 10, 2020, we appointed David Sipes as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors.  IMPACTS OF COVID-19  The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including those set forth under the section entitled  Risk Factors.  In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, including orders to close non-essential businesses, isolate residents to their homes, and practice social distancing. To protect the health and safety of our employees, our workforce has spent significant time working from home and travel has been curtailed for our employees as well as our customers. Small and medium-sized customers have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also experienced significant increases in usage by existing customers as our customers workforces are required to work from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating trends we have seen in distributed workforces increasingly relying on cloud communication systems like ours. While we anticipate that the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 and the measures enacted to slow its spread will negatively impact business activity across the globe, it is not clear what its potential effects will be on our business, including the effects on our customers, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.  COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Service Revenue  Service revenue consists of communication services subscriptions, platform usage revenue, and related fees from our UCaaS, CCaaS, and CPaaS offerings. We plan to continue driving our business to increase service revenue through a combination of increased sales and marketing efforts, geographic expansion of our customer base outside the United States, innovation in product and technology, and through strategic acquisitions of technologies and businesses.  Other Revenue  Other revenue consists of revenues from professional services, primarily in support of deployment of our solutions and or platform, and revenues from sales and rentals of IP telephones in conjunction with our cloud telephony service. Other revenue is dependent on the number of customers who choose to purchase or rent an IP telephone in conjunction with our service instead of using the solution on their cell phone, computer or other compatible device, and or choose to engage our services for implementation and deployment of our cloud services.  Cost of Service Revenue  Cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs associated with network operations and related personnel, technology licenses, amortization of capitalized internal-use software, other communication origination and termination services provided by third-party carriers and outsourced customer service call center operations, and other costs such as customer service, and technical support costs. We allocate overhead costs such as IT and facilities to cost of service revenue, as well as to each of the operating expense categories, generally based on relative headcount. Our IT costs include costs for IT infrastructure and personnel. Facilities costs primarily consist of office leases and related expenses.  Cost of Other Revenue  Cost of other revenue consists primarily of direct and indirect costs associated with the purchasing of IP telephones as well as the scheduling, shipping and handling, personnel costs, expenditures incurred in connection with the professional services associated with the deployment and implementation of our products, and allocated IT and facilities costs.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, third-party development, software and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our product, platform development and engineering efforts, and allocated IT and facilities costs.  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, sales commissions, including those to the channel, trade shows, advertising and other marketing, demand generation, promotional expenses, and allocated IT and facilities costs.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs, professional services fees, corporate administrative costs, tax and regulatory fees, and allocated IT and facilities costs.  Other Income  Expense , net  Other income  expense , net, consists primarily of interest expense related to the convertible notes, offset by income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, investments, and foreign exchange gain losses.  Provision for Income Taxes  Provision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign income taxes and state minimum taxes in the United States. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. and foreign taxation of such activities may increase our overall provision for income taxes in the future. We have a valuation allowance for our U.S. deferred tax assets, including federal and state net operating loss carryforwards   NOLs  . We expect to maintain this valuation allowance until it becomes more likely than not that the benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the United States.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.  We have minimal seasonality in our business, but typically, sales of new subscriptions in our fourth fiscal quarter are greater than in any of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We believe this occurs because the customers we target tend to spend a relatively greater portion of their annual capital budgets at the beginning of the calendar year compared with each of the last three quarters of the year.  Revenue  Service revenue  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Service revenue  495,985  414,078  325,305   81,907 19.8     88,773 27.3    Percentage of total revenue 93.2   92.8   92.3    Service revenue increased for fiscal 2021, as compared with fiscal 2020, primarily due to a net increase in our customer base, expanded offerings to existing customers, and growth in related usage; service revenue from new customers was primarily driven by sales of standalone and bundled UCaaS and CCaaS deals, globally, to our mid-market and enterprise customers. The increase in service revenue was also attributable to growth in usage revenue generated by our CPaaS products primarily in the APAC region. Our service subscriber base grew from approximately 55,000 customers on March 31, 2020 to approximately 58,000 customers on March 31, 2021.  Service revenue increased for fiscal 2020, as compared with fiscal 2019, primarily due to a net increase in our customer subscriber base, with the largest part of the increase coming from our mid-market and enterprise customers, who are our fastest growing customer sector, contributing to an increase in the average annual service revenue per customer. This increase was primarily due to organic growth and, to a lesser extent, CPaaS revenue generated in connection with our acquisition of Wavecell in July 2019. Our service subscriber base grew from approximately 52,000 customers on March 31, 2019 to approximately 55,000 customers on March 31, 2020.  We expect total service revenue to grow over time with our diverse platform offering as our business continues to expand globally and across broader customer categories.  Other revenue  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Other revenue  36,359  32,159  27,281   4,200 13.1     4,878 17.9    Percentage of total revenue 6.8   7.2   7.7    Other revenue increased in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased professional services revenue resulting from the overall growth in our business and customer base, partially offset by a decrease in product revenue as a result of a shift toward our hardware rental program.  Other revenue increased in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to increased professional services revenue resulting from the overall growth in our business and customer base and increased product revenue.  We expect other revenue to grow over time as our customer base grows, particularly in mid-market and enterprise, as we focus on delivering enhanced platform offerings to existing and new customers.  No single customer represented more than 10  of our total revenues during fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019.  Revenues are attributed to countries based on the shipment destination and the customer's service address. The following table illustrates our revenues by geographic area   For the years ended March 31,  2021 2020 2019  United States 73   79   86    International 27   21   14    Total 100   100   100    Revenue generated from international customers increased in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019 due to expansion in both EMEA and APAC regions, including those added in connection with our acquisition of Wavecell.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of service revenue  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Cost of service revenue  180,082  145,013  86,122   35,069 24.2     58,891 68.4    Percentage of service revenue 36.3   35.0   26.5    Cost of service revenue increased in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a  33.6 million increase in communication infrastructure costs incurred to deliver our services, including those in connection with CPaaS, a  6.4 million increase in amortization of capitalized internal-use software, and a  3.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of  5.3 million in employee and consulting related expenditures and a decrease of  2.5 million in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.  Cost of service revenue increased in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a  33.8 million increase in communication infrastructure costs incurred to deliver our services, including those in connection with CPaaS, a  7.1 million increase in amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, a  6.5 million increase in facilities and other allocated expenses, a  6.8 million increase in employee and consulting related expenditures,  1.9 million increase in amortization of intangibles, and a  1.1 million increase in software expense.  We expect cost of service revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as revenue continues to grow.  Cost of other revenue  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Cost of other revenue   50,068   56,215   43,850    6,147   10.9      12,365 28.2    Percentage of other revenue 137.7   174.8   160.7    Cost of other revenue decreased in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to reductions in hardware shipment volume, improved pricing, and increase in our hardware rental program, which has better margins than hardware sales.  Cost of other revenue increased in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to increased product shipments and personnel and other costs associated with customer deployments.  Operating Expenses  Research and development  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Research and development   92,034   77,790   62,063   14,244 18.3     15,727 25.3    Percentage of total revenue 17.3   17.4   17.6    Research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to an  11.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a  3.0 million reduction in capitalized internal-use software costs, and a  1.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization of software. These increases were partially offset by a  1.2 million decrease in travel related costs.  Research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to an  8.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a  3.7 million increase in payroll and related expenses, net of capitalized internal-use software costs, a  2.2 million increase in amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs, and a  1.5 million increase in software expenses.  We plan to continue to invest in research and development to support our efforts to expand the capabilities and scope of our platform and to enhance the user experience. While we expect to continue to improve our cost structure and achieve operational efficiencies, we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in our development efforts, and vary from period-to-period as a percentage of revenue.  Sales and marketing  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Sales and marketing  256,231  240,013  177,976   16,218 6.8     62,037 34.9    Percentage of total revenue 48.1   53.8   50.5    Sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a  14.9 million increase in channel commissions, a  13.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a  8.3 million increase in amortization of deferred sales commission costs, a  3.7 million increase in marketing software and application costs, and a  3.2 million increase in employee and consulting related expenditures. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of  27.2 million in marketing program and public cloud expenses due to gained efficiencies in lead generation and brand awareness, along with a reduction in travel related costs.  Sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a  20.4 million increase in advertising and marketing expenses, a  16.1 million increase in payroll and related expenses from expansion of our sales force, an  8.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a  7.2 million increase in commission expenses, a  5.3 million increase in amortization of deferred sales commissions, a  1.5 million increase in recruiting and outside services, a  1.3 million increase in licenses and fees, and a  0.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization of intangibles.  We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing to attract and retain customers on our platform and to increase our brand awareness. While we expect to continue to improve our cost structure and achieve operational efficiencies, we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and vary from period-to-period as a percentage of revenue.  General and administrative  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  General and administrative  100,078  87,025  72,208   13,053 15.0     14,817 20.5    Percentage of total revenue 18.8   19.5   20.5    General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a  6.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, a  5.7 million increase in professional services and payroll and related expenses, including CEO succession costs, a  1.3 million higher allowance for credit losses, partially in response to external market factors and uncertainties in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, and a  1.8 million increase in depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by a  2.2 million decrease in acquisition and integration costs.  General and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to an  11.8 million increase in payroll and related expenses, a  7.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses, a  3.5 million increase in rent expense related to additional office spaces, a  2.4 million increase in bad debt expense, and a  2.4 million increase in acquisition and integration related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in allocated costs of  7.0 million, and the non-recurrence of sales and use tax expenses of  7.6 million that the Company recognized in fiscal 2019.  We expect to continue improving our cost structure and achieve operational efficiencies, and therefore also expect that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will decline over time.  Other income  expense , net  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Other income  expense , net   18,593     11,717    1,463    6,876  58.7      13,180   900.9     Percentage of total revenue  3.5     2.6    0.4    The change in Other income  expense , net in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020, was primarily due to  4.0 million of lower interest income and a  3.1 million increase in expense related to contractual interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of issuance costs associated with additional convertible notes issued in November 2019. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in other income of  0.6 million.  The change in Other income  expense , net in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily related to recognition of interest, amortization of debt discount, and amortization of issuance costs associated with our convertible senior notes issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which totaled  15.6 million in fiscal 2020, as compared to  1.5 million in fiscal 2019. This increase in other expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income of  1.6 million.  With the recognition of interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs in connection with our convertible senior notes, we expect Other income  expense , net to continue to be in a net expense position for the foreseeable future.  Provision for income taxes  For the years ended March 31, Change  2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019  Provision for income taxes   843   832   569   11 1.3     263 46.2    Percentage of total revenue 0.2   0.2   0.2    For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded income tax expense of  0.8 million and  0.8 million, respectively, mostly related to the current tax liabilities of profitable foreign subsidiaries and U.S. state minimum taxes. Our effective tax rate for each period differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.  We record deferred taxes based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A significant item of objective negative evidence considered was the historical three-year cumulative pretax loss reached in fiscal 2018. We continue to remain in a cumulative pretax loss position, and therefore, continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S., U.K., and Singapore deferred tax assets.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2021, we had  152.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition, we had  8.6 million in restricted cash in support of letters of credit securing leases for office facilities in California and New York. During fiscal 2021,  10.4 million previously held in escrow for our acquisition of Wavecell was released.  As of March 31, 2020, we had  170.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition, we had  19.0 million in restricted cash, of which  8.6 million was in support of letters of credit securing leases for office facilities in California and New York and  10.4 million was held in escrow for our acquisition of Wavecell, pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement.  On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act  the  CARES Act   was passed into law, which amended portions of relevant tax laws and provided relief to certain qualifying entities. In connection with the CARES Act, the Company elected to defer certain employer payroll taxes, which reduced cash usage by approximately  5.0 million through December 31, 2020, of which approximately  2.5 million will be remitted to tax authorities during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and the remaining amount due will be remitted in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Other jurisdictions around the world have also provided similar tax relief, which the Company has elected to receive, where applicable; these benefits have a lesser impact to our cash flows during fiscal 2021.  In June 2020, the Company offered its employees an opportunity to receive a portion of their future cash salary for fiscal 2021 in shares of the Company's common stock, which resulted in lower cash usage from payroll compensation of approximately  4 million during fiscal 2021. In addition, for fiscal 2021, the Company's executives received performance share units in place of a cash bonus plan and the timing of bonus payments for all other eligible employees was changed to semi-annually  in the third and first quarter of each fiscal year  from quarterly as in prior fiscal years.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we received  6.4 million of operating cash inflows from our Lease Assignment. Refer to Note 5. Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.  In March 2021, the Company offered its employees another opportunity to receive a portion of their fiscal 2022 cash salary and or cash bonus in shares of the Company's common stock. Based on employee elected participation, we expect lower cash usage from payroll compensation of over  9 million during fiscal 2022.  We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the next 12 months, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, in each case, in light of the market volatility and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, among other factors, could impact our business and liquidity.  Year over Year Changes  Net cash used in operating activities for fiscal 2021 was  14.1 million, as compared with  93.9 million for fiscal 2020. Cash used in or provided by operating activities is primarily affected by   net income or loss;  non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization, and impairments;  expense associated with stock options and stock-based awards; and  changes in working capital accounts, particularly in the timing of collections from receivable and payments of obligations, such as commissions.  In fiscal 2021, net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to our net loss of  165.6 million, net cash outflow from sales commissions payments and recognition of deferred sales commissions of  25.1 million, and other smaller working capital changes, which were partially offset by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation expense of  107.6 million, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs of  26.9 million, amortization of debt discount of  16.9 million, and operating lease expenses of  15.2 million.  In fiscal 2020, net cash used in operating activities was primarily related to our net loss of  172.4 million, net cash outflow from sales commissions of  26.9 million, and other smaller working capital changes, which were partially offset by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation expense of  70.9 million, amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs of  19.0 million, amortization of the debt discount of  14.0 million, and operating lease expenses of  15.0 million.  Net cash used in investing activities was  36.3 million in fiscal 2021, as compared to  106.3 million in fiscal 2020. The cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021, was primarily related to capitalized internal-use software development costs of  28.8 million, net cash paid of  10.4 million in connection with our acquisition of Wavecell, and purchases of property and equipment of  6.4 million. This was partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases, of  9.3 million.  Net cash used in investing activities was  106.3 million during fiscal 2020, as compared to  10.9 million provided by investing activities in fiscal 2019. The cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to purchases of property and equipment of  35.8 million, largely in connection with the build out of our corporate office, capitalized internal-use software development costs of  31.6 million, and net cash paid of  59.1 million in connection with our acquisitions. This was partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases, of  20.2 million.  Net cash provided by financing activities was  13.2 million in fiscal 2021, as compared to  72.1 million in fiscal 2020. The cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021, was primarily from the issuance of common stock of  13.3 million, primarily from employee stock purchase plans and employee option exercises.  Net cash provided by financing activities was  72.1 million in fiscal 2020, as compared to  249.2 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2019. The cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020, was primarily from the issuance of convertible debt of  73.9 million and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase plans of  14.3 million. These inflows were partially offset by  9.3 million in capped call transactions and  6.6 million to settle payroll tax obligations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of March 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303 a  4  ii  of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.  As set forth below in our contractual obligations table, we do have inventory purchases and other commitments incurred in the normal course of business. We may also agree in the normal course of business to indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with us with respect to matters such as breaches of representations or covenants or intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. See Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information about our indemnification arrangements.  Contractual Obligations  Obligations related to our convertible senior notes, operating lease payments, and purchase obligations at March 31, 2021 for the next five years were as follows   Payments Due by Period  Total Less than  1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than  5 years  Convertible senior notes   362,500   -   362,500   -   -  Operating lease obligations 1   113,049 16,341 27,000 22,015 47,693  Lease assignment contract 1   868 868 - - -  Purchase obligations 18,625 5,051 13,574 - -  Total   495,042   22,260   403,074   22,015   47,693   1  See Note 5, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   ESTIMATES  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to Note 1, The Company and Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  We have identified the policies below as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations. These policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual future results may differ from our estimates. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results.  Revenue Recognition  Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.  Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, based on the transaction price. We generally bill our customers on a monthly basis. Contracts typically range from annual to multi-year agreements, generally with payment terms of net 30 days.  We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns and customer credits at the time the related revenue is recognized. Sales returns and customer credits are estimated based on our historical experience, current trends, and our expectations regarding future service delivery and platform performance. We monitor the accuracy of its sales reserve estimates by reviewing actual returns and credits and adjusts them for its future expectations to determine the adequacy of its current and future reserve needs. If actual future returns and credits differ from past experience, additional reserves may be required.  Service Revenue Recognition  Service revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based technology platform is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term beginning on the date that the platform is delivered to the customer until the end of the contractual period. Payments received in advance of subscription services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue; revenue recognized for services rendered in advance of payments received are recorded as contract assets. Usage fees, when bundled, are billed in advance and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term. Non-bundled usage fees are recognized as actual usage occurs.  Other Revenue Recognition  Other revenue is primarily comprised of product revenue and professional services revenue. We recognize product revenue for telephony equipment at a point in time, when transfer of control has occurred, which is generally upon shipment. Sales returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue estimated based on historical experience. Professional services for deployment, configuration, system integration, optimization, customer training or education are primarily billed on a fixed-fee basis and are performed by us directly. Professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or upon completion of the deployment.  Allowance for Credit Losses  We account for allowances for credit losses under the current expected credit loss  CECL  impairment model for our financial assets, including accounts receivable, and present the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The CECL impairment model requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, that considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. Using this model, we estimate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses at the end of each reporting period based on the aging of the receivable balance, current and historical customer trends, communications with customers, and macro-economic conditions. Amounts are written off after considerable collection efforts have been made and the amounts are determined to be uncollectible.  Capitalized Internal-Use Software Costs  Certain software development costs for computer software developed internally or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage. We begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Once the project has been completed, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in the applicable income statement category, typically research and development, in our consolidated statements of operations."}

Our Products Address Today's Communication Challenges  With the onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, organizations of all types have been compelled to embrace a digital-first world where video adoption and utilization are at the core of every remote working and learning solution for education, communication, and collaboration. With Sonic Foundrys 30-year reputation as a leader in video technology, the Company is well-positioned to capitalize on the new fundamental needs for rapid and remote communication in a post-pandemic world as well as aligning organizations with the tech-savvy generations now in the workplace. Sonic Foundrys products and services can help customers efficiently and cost-effectively address the challenge of sharing information whenever and wherever content is consumed through our award-winning Mediasite video platform.  Sonic Foundry, Inc.  Annual Report on Form 10-K  For the Year Ended September 30, 2021  Mediasite Video Capture Solutions  Mediasite provides the following primary flexible hardware and software solutions to record and upload any video-based content from anywhere, automatically     Mediasite Recorder and Recorder Pro  The Recorder and Recorder Pro are built-in room appliances that use schedule-based capture and advanced audio video integration to fully automate high-quality video and content recording in lecture halls, training rooms, simulation labs and auditoriums. The room can be scheduled to automatically record and publish to Mediasite, so instructors and speakers can focus on teaching and presenting, free from technology worries and confident that everything said and presented is being captured.    Mediasite Mobile Recorders  The Mobile Recorder is a portable recording device used to capture and stream broadcast-quality video from any environment when portability is key. Designed for on-the-go webcasting, hybrid events, guest speakers and conferences, the lightweight design moves easily from location to location and can be set up and ready to record in only a few minutes.    Mediasite Mosaic  Formerly known as My Mediasite, Mosaic allows instructors, employees and students to create high quality videos, screencasts and slideshows from their computers or mobile devices with just one click. From demos and video training to flipped classes, lectures and assignments, everything needed to record, upload, manage and publish personal videos is in one simple-to-use tool, requiring no pro video skills   Mediasite Catch  Mediasite Catch is a video capture software solution that is scalable, reliable, and economical for classrooms not equipped with extensive audio video capabilities. Mediasite Catch expands automation to classrooms with little to no audio video capabilities and complements the existing Mediasite suite of content capture solutions. It can accommodate as many classrooms as needed.  As a result of COVID, many of our customers switched to remote work and teaching, and the need for traditional in-room video capture slowed. While this caused a temporary dislocation for Sonic Foundrys customary offerings, the Companys medium, and long-term opportunity for providing enhanced digital capabilities multiplied. The way we live, work and play has been permanently disrupted, ushering a new era of being connected on-demand. Sonic Foundry offers its customers an end-to-end solution that can be rapidly and efficiently deployed with its Mediasite Video Management and Delivery Solutions.  Mediasite Video Management and Delivery Solutions  Mediasite is a scalable, reliable, and secure solution to manage, search, analyze, publish, and stream video content. With Mediasite, government, businesses, and education institutions can     Automatically publish video to a learning management system  LMS , content management system  CMS , training portal or any website    Centrally manage and secure any video   Create an enterprise or campus YouTube channel    Deepen engagement and improve learning with quizzing, annotations, comments, polls, surveys and other interactive tools   Analyze viewing metrics to measure learner engagement and outcomes    Search everything with fully indexed audio, video and slide content    Stream live and on-demand video to any device  Mediasite On-Premises or Mediasite Cloud  Mediasite is available as either an on-premises license or as a SaaS  Software as a Service  offering within our Mediasite Cloud. Customers can conveniently host and manage all their content with Mediasite Cloud, or use it as needed for large events to divert heavy viewing traffic from their on-premises Mediasite deployment. Our co-located and high availability data centers and experienced team successfully manage customers cloud-based video streaming in a secure, fault-tolerant environment. During 2020, the Company made an investment in a new dual redundant, high availability data center in the United Kingdom, which went online at the end of September 2020. The Company also upgraded its existing US data centers, which went online during the first calendar quarter of 2021.  COVID Accelerated the Use of Video as a Key Communications Tool by Possibly Ten Years  Even before COVID, companies were increasingly focused on becoming digital-forward enterprises. Anticipating this new market paradigm, Sonic Foundry invested in its data center infrastructure to help customers achieve their IT support objectives prior to COVID. Consequently, the Company was prepared to immediately support customer needs for handling the dramatic and rapid increase in data storage by migrating them to Mediasite Cloud. This accelerated customer adoption of Sonic Foundrys cloud strategy and generated additional cloud revenue.  Any further hardware investment required would be offset by an increase in revenue from hosting. The Company believes the significant increase in video content creation will proliferate as video conferencing systems like Zoom and Teams are used to record meetings and presentations. Between 2019-2021, Sonic Foundry developed and released an advanced integration to seamlessly automate workflow between Zoom or Teams, Mediasite, and a school's LMS. This allows all video content to be edited and managed in one secure location regardless of how it was recorded. Given the ongoing supply chain disruption, the Company believes any delays and uncertainty in hardware orders will be offset by increasing software licenses and cloud contracts.  Sonic Foundry, Inc.  Annual Report on Form 10-K  For the Year Ended September 30, 2021  Our Service Offerings Address the New Virtual World  Mediasite Events  Mediasite Events provides live and on-demand webcasting services for conferences, hybrid events and high-profile broadcasts, supplying turnkey streaming solutions for hundreds of events each year. Fortune 500 companies, universities, associations, sporting events and charitable organizations use Mediasite Events to capture, produce, and deliver high-quality event experiences, both in-person and virtually.  Our Mediasite Events business, both in the United States  US  and Japan, was significantly impacted by COVID. In early March 2020, all near-term, in-person events started to cancel due to concerns over the virus. While the Companys in-person pipeline for the remainder of March and April shrunk to zero, it quickly replaced in-person events with virtual events. Since late March 2020, the US team has been helping customers continue to hold high-quality events via our virtual events platform, which utilizes Mediasite technology. In-person events did not resume at a typical level in fiscal 2021 based on continued concern over virus variants. As in-person events resume, the Company is optimistic that virtual events will remain an ongoing solution for the event industry.  Mediasite Professional Services  Customers maximize their return on video with additional Mediasite Services including integration services, installation assistance, custom development, training, and monitoring services  . While COVID impacted the Companys ability to do onsite services, it has been able to provide the majority of our professional services remotely, allowing the opportunity to provide uninterrupted year-round professional services support to new users and existing customers.  Mediasite Customer Care  Mediasite Customer Care plans include software upgrades for Mediasite and Mediasite capture solutions, technical support, warranty extensions and advanced replacement on hardware, as well as access to the Mediasite Community and other online resources. Nearly all our customers purchase a Customer Care plan when they purchase Mediasite or Mediasite capture solutions. Annual service contracts for Mediasite Video Cloud include a Standard Customer Care plan. COVID has not had an immediate impact on our Customer Care plans. It is, however, difficult to predict the long-term impact should the pandemic persist.  Sonic Foundry, Inc.  Annual Report on Form 10-K  For the Year Ended September 30, 2021  Segment Information  In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  280-10, Segment Reporting, the Company has three operating segments; however, these segments meet the criteria for aggregation for reporting purposes as one reporting segment as of September 30, 2021.  Billings  Our services are typically billed and collected in advance of providing the service. Billings, which are a non-GAAP measure, are an important indicator of customer activity and cash flow in addition to revenue, and is therefore used by management as a key operational indicator. Billings are computed by combining revenue with the change in unearned revenue.  Our largest individual customers can be either value added resellers  VARs  or end users in the case of large higher education institutions. No single customer represented over 10  of billings or revenue in 2021 or 2020.  Sales  We sell and market our offerings through a sales force that manages a channel of value-added resellers, system integrators, and consultants. These third-party representatives specialize in understanding both audio video systems and IT networking. We also sold to approximately 300 resellers, and over 1,150 total end users.  Market expansion   Historically, over two-thirds of our revenue has been realized from the education market. However, COVID escalated the rapid adoption of video as a remote work and learning solution across all industry sectors. This development represents an exciting trend that can extend Sonic Foundrys market opportunity beyond the traditional academic customer base into new verticals.  For our higher education as well as corporate, government and association clients, we anticipate economic conditions will expand market demand for more outsourced services versus licensed, on-premises sales. Over the last two years, the Company has made extensive capital and technology investments to advance its services model with turnkey event webcasting, a comprehensive cloud-based Software as a Service  SaaS  datacenter, and e-commerce capabilities that position us to diversify our customer base as well as generate more recurring revenues.  For our Mediasite Events business both in the US and Japan, we continue to see growing demand for virtual events that we believe will extend beyond COVID. These event-based communication, education and training platforms are expected to help drive the Companys corporate sales activities going forward.  While the competitive landscape has grown in the past two years, we believe our services offerings, particularly as it relates to high-touch white glove event services, give us a distinct advantage over the many virtual event platforms that have launched opportunistically since COVID. As enterprises and education institutions return to a new normal mixed audiences of in person and virtual, we are confident our experience and reputation automating and recording from mixed spaces will position us well over offerings that cater to in person only or virtual only.  Sonic Foundry, Inc.  Annual Report on Form 10-K  For the Year Ended September 30, 2021  Operations  We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Instead we contract with a third party to build the hardware for our Mediasite Recorders and purchase quantities sufficient to fill specific customer orders, including purchases of inventory by resellers. Quantities are maintained in inventory by the third-party provider and shipped directly to the end customer or reseller. The hardware manufacturer provides a limited one-year warranty on the hardware, which is passed on to our customers who purchase a Mediasite Customer Care support and maintenance plan. While we have long standing relationships with our contract manufacturers, there are other manufacturing alternatives if needed.  Research and Development  We believe that our future success will depend on our ability to deepen our relationship with current customers and attract new customers by offering a compelling value proposition that enhances their workplace and business objectives. Accordingly, we invest a significant amount of our resources in research and development activities, with a particular focus on our SaaS offerings. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we spent  7.2 million and  6.3 million, respectively, on internal research and development activities in our business. These amounts represent 20  in 2021 and 18  in 2020 of total revenue.  Global Expansion  In fiscal 2014, we acquired MediaMission B.V.in the Netherlands and Mediasite KK in Japan. With these acquisitions, we significantly expanded our global market reach in Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region and accelerated our commitment to enterprise video communication worldwide. The investment in maintaining a local presence in these regions has allowed us to better serve the ongoing sales and support demands of our customers and prospective customers in those markets. Additionally, weve been able to deploy customer care and cloud hosting services more quickly in each of those markets to capitalize on the trend to move data intensive applications, such as video, to the cloud.  Human Capital  At September 30, 2021 and 2020, we had 180 and 177 full-time employees, respectively. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they subject to a collective bargaining agreement.  We have a competitive compensation plan and benefits plan that is designed to attract, retain, and reward individuals and includes an employee stock purchase plan and a 401k plan with a matching contribution. Through our volunteer program, employees are granted 3 days of PTO per calendar year to volunteer and support the local and global community."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following is a discussion of the material factors that make an investment in the Company and its securities speculative or risky. The risks described herein are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  Demand for our software solutions is subject to volatility in our accounts underlying businesses, which includes infrastructure projects that typically have long timelines.  Our sales are based significantly on accounts demand for software solutions in the following infrastructure sectors   i  public works utilities;  ii  industrial resources; and  iii  commercial facilities. Although these sectors are typically countercyclical to one another in nature, each periodically experiences economic declines and may be exacerbated by other economic factors. If participants in any of these sectors reduce spending or allocate future funding in a manner that results in fewer infrastructure improvement or expansion projects, then our accounts underlying business may be impacted and demand for our software solutions may decrease or our rate of contract renewals may decrease. A prolonged decrease in such spending may harm our results of operations. Our accounts may request discounts or extended payment terms on new arrangements or seek to extend payment terms on existing arrangements due to lower levels of infrastructure spending or for other reasons, all of which may reduce revenue. We may not be able to adjust our operating expenses to offset such discounts or other arrangements because a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel, facilities, and marketing programs. The level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based, in significant part, on our expectations for future revenues and demand.  Infrastructure projects typically have long timelines and we may invest in building capacity based on expected demand for our software solutions that takes longer to develop than we expect or fails to develop at all. Additionally, government spending on infrastructure may decrease, which could decrease the demand for our software solutions and have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be successful in forecasting future demand levels and could fail to win business at the expected rates. If we underestimate the demand for our software solutions, we may be unable to fulfill the increased demand in a timely fashion or at all. If we overestimate the demand for our software solutions, we may incur additional expenses for which we would not have corresponding revenues, negatively impacting our results of operations.  The ongoing global coronavirus outbreak could materially and adversely affect our business.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the rapidly growing outbreak of the disease COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 outbreak and certain preventative or protective actions that governments, businesses, and individuals have taken in respect of COVID-19 have resulted in global business disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economies, financial markets, and the overall environment in which we do business, and the extent to which it may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a modest impact on the usage of our solutions by our users. Throughout 2020, usage rates as compared to comparable periods in the prior year have fluctuated between modest increases to modest decreases. There can be no assurance that we will not experience more severe downward trends in usage for as long as the pandemic lasts and thereafter. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, and the impact of these and other factors on our colleagues, accounts, suppliers, and partners. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to materially affect the economies and financial markets in impacted countries and countries in which we operate, causing continued economic downturn that could decrease spending on infrastructure projects and adversely affect demand for our software solutions. Such impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, and or cash flows could be material. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as, but not limited to, those related to supply chain interruptions and labor availability and cost.  The majority of our revenues and an increasing percentage of our operations are attributable to operations outside the United States, and our results of operations therefore may be materially affected by the legal, regulatory, social, political, economic, and other risks of foreign operations.  Approximately 57 , 58 , and 60  of our total revenues were from outside the United States for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We anticipate that revenues from accounts outside the United States will continue to comprise a majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future.  Our international revenues, including from emerging economies, are subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets and our revenues are impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenues over time. These factors could adversely impact our international revenues and, consequently, our business. Our dependency on international revenues also makes us more exposed to global economic and political trends, which can negatively impact our financial results. Further, our operations outside the United States are subject to legal, regulatory, social, political, economic, and other risks inherent in international business operations, including, without limitation, local product preference and product requirements, trade protection measures, sanctions, quotas, embargoes, import and export licensing requirements, duties, tariffs or surcharges and more stringent regulations relating to privacy and data security and access to, or use of, commercial and personal information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation  the GDPR  applicable in the European Union  E.U. , and the Cybersecurity Law of the Peoples Republic of China.  The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.  Decreased investment by APAC, including China, may have a negative effect on our business.  Approximately 19 , 20 , and 19  of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, relate to infrastructure projects in APAC, including China. We cannot assure you that spending in these countries on infrastructure projects will continue at historical levels or increase in the future, or that demand for our software solutions in APAC in general will not be negatively affected by reductions in spending or other limitations.  We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.  We sell our solutions in 172 countries, primarily through a direct sales force located throughout the world. Approximately 57 , 58 , and 60  of our total revenues were from outside the United States for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As we continue to expand our presence in international regions, the portion of our revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable, and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies continues to increase. Further, we anticipate that revenues from accounts outside of the United States will continue to comprise the majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future.  Because of our international activities, we have revenue, expenses, cash, accounts receivable and payment obligations denominated in foreign currencies. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 43 , 47 , and 49 , respectively, of our total revenues were denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar. As a result, we are subject to currency exchange risk. Our revenues and results of operations are adversely affected when the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the U.S. Dollar weakens. As a result, changes in currency exchange rates will affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In the event that there are economic declines in countries in which we conduct transactions, the resulting changes in currency exchange rates may affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We are most impacted by movements in and among the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, and Chinese Yuan Renminbi. For example, the Chinese Yuan Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. Dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably, due to changes in foreign exchange for a wide variety of reasons, including actions instituted by China. Because of changes in trade between the United States and China and Renminbi internationalization, the China may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system, and we cannot assure you that the Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. Dollar in  the future.  In addition, countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies, requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations, or such countries currencies may be devalued, or both, which may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and we may not be successful in minimizing the risks of these fluctuations. In addition, the fluctuation and volatility of currencies, even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses, impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings.  We may not be able to increase the number of new subscription-based accounts or cause existing accounts to renew their subscriptions, which could have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.  We may not be able to increase demand for our subscription-based services in line with our growth strategy. Our accounts are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings, and they may elect not to renew. We cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals. Account renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors, including offering pricing, competitive offerings, account satisfaction, and reductions in account spending levels or account activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty. If our accounts do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Consolidation among our accounts and other enterprises in the markets in which we operate may result in a loss of business.  It is likely that some of our existing accounts will consolidate, be acquired, or experience a change in management, which could lead to a decrease in the size of our account base. We expect consolidation among our accounts as they attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. If two or more of our accounts consolidate, they may also wish to consolidate the software solutions and services that we provide to them. If an existing account is acquired by another company that uses the solutions of one of our competitors, we may lose business in that account to our competitor. In addition, if an account experiences a change in management, the new management team may be accustomed to the software of one of our competitors, and we could lose that account. Any such consolidation, acquisition, or management change could lead to pricing pressure, erosion of our margins, loss of accounts, and loss of market share, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We have in the past and expect to continue in the future to seek to grow our business through acquisitions of or investments in new or complementary businesses, software solutions, or technologies, and the failure to manage acquisitions or investments, or the failure to integrate them with our existing platform and business, could harm us.  Since our founding, we have strategically acquired and integrated numerous software assets and businesses. We may, however, be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future or, if suitable candidates are identified, we may be unable to complete the business combination on commercially acceptable terms. The process of exploring and pursuing acquisition opportunities may result in devotion of significant management and financial resources.  Even if we are able to consummate acquisitions that we believe will be successful, these transactions present many risks including, among others, failing to achieve anticipated synergies and revenue increases, difficulty incorporating and integrating the acquired technologies or software solutions with our offerings and existing applications, difficulties managing an acquired companys technologies or lines of business or entering new markets where we have limited prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions, and the loss of key colleagues, accounts, and channel partners of ours or of the acquired company.  Quality problems, defects, errors, failures, or vulnerabilities in our software solutions or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.  Our solutions are, in some cases, highly complex and incorporate advanced software technologies that we attempt to make interoperable with the products of other software providers. Despite testing prior to release, our software may contain undetected defects or errors. Further, the combined use of our software with those of other software providers may cause errors or failures, or it may expose undetected defects, errors, or failures in our software. These defects, errors, or failures could affect software performance and damage the businesses of our accounts, as well as delay the development or release of new software or new versions of software. Further, we cannot guarantee that all of our accounts are using the latest versions of our software solutions with enhanced security features and may be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Allegations of unsatisfactory performance in any of these situations could damage our reputation in the market and our relationships with our accounts, cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing, correcting, or redesigning the software, cause us to lose accounts, subject us to liability for damages, and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective software. We cannot assure you that such remediation would not harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be harmed if we are unable to cross-sell our solutions.  A significant component of our growth strategy is to increase the cross-selling of our solutions to current and future accounts, however, we may not be successful in doing so if our accounts find our additional solutions to be unnecessary or unattractive. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in developing and acquiring additional solutions, which resources may not be recovered if we are unable to successfully cross-sell these solutions to accounts using our existing solutions. Any failure to sell additional solutions to current and future accounts could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.  There are significant costs and restrictions associated with the repatriation of cash from our non-U.S. operations.  Our cash and cash equivalents balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with approximately 94  of those balances held outside of the United States as of December 31, 2020. Cash repatriation restrictions may limit our ability to repatriate cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. Additionally, the repatriation of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries may result in adverse tax consequences. Any repatriation of cash may be restricted or may result in our incurring substantial costs. As a result, we may be required to seek sources of cash to fund our operations, including through the issuance of equity securities, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders, or by incurring additional indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure sources of financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.  From time to time we realign or introduce new business initiatives, including reorganizing our sales and marketing, research and development, and administrative functions; if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.  We rely heavily on our direct sales force. From time to time, we reorganize and make adjustments to our sales leadership and or our sales force in response to such factors as management changes, performance issues, market opportunities, and other considerations. These changes may result in a temporary lack of sales production and may adversely impact revenues in future quarters. Market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our accounts needs at the right time and price. There can be no assurance that we will not restructure our sales force in future periods or that the transition issues associated with such a restructuring will not occur. Similarly, reorganization of our research and development and administrative functions can disrupt our operations and negatively impact our results of operations if the execution is not managed properly. If any of our assumptions about expenses, revenues, or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results could be negatively impacted.  A portion of our revenues are from sales by our channel partners and we could be subject to loss or liability based on their actions.  Sales through our global network of independent regional channel partners accounted for 8  of our revenues  under Topic 606  for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and 9  of our revenues  under Topic 605  for the year ended December 31, 2018. These channel partners sell our software solutions to smaller accounts, in geographic regions where we do not have a meaningful presence, and in niche markets where they have specialized industry and technical knowledge. Where we rely on channel partners, we may have reduced contact with ultimate users that purchase through such channel partners, thereby making it more difficult to establish brand awareness, ensure proper installation, service ongoing requirements, estimate demand, and respond to the evolving needs of an account. Any of our channel partners may choose to terminate its relationship with us at any time. As a result, our ability to service the ultimate users who were interfacing with that channel partner may take time to develop as we divert resources to service those users directly or find a suitable alternative channel partner to continue the relationship. Any disruption in service may damage our reputation and business. In addition, our channel partners may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and revenues. Our channel partners may also not have loyalty to our brand and therefore may not be particularly motivated to sell our software solutions or services.  The use of channel partners could also subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our software solutions or services to accounts, fail to comply with their contractual obligations, or violate laws or our corporate policies. Such actions may impact our ability to distribute our software solutions into certain regions and markets, and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  Risks Related to Information Technology Systems and Intellectual Property  Interruptions in the availability of server systems or communications with Internet, third-party hosting facilities or cloud-based services, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility, or integrity of data stored on such systems, could harm our business or impair the delivery of our managed services.  A significant portion of our software development personnel, source code, and computer equipment is located at operating facilities outside the United States. We also depend on data maintained on servers running third-party enterprise resource planning, account relationship management, and other business operations systems. We further rely upon a variety of Internet service providers, third-party hosting facilities, and cloud computing platform providers, such as Microsoft Azure, as well as local service providers to support project teams and users in most regions and countries throughout the world, particularly with respect to our cloud service solutions. Failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility, or integrity of data stored on such systems could damage our reputation in the market and our relationships with our accounts, cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs, cause us to lose accounts, subject us to liability for damages, and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Any damage to, or failure of, such systems, or communications to and between such systems, could result in interruptions in our operations, managed services, and software development activities. Such interruptions may reduce our revenue, delay billing, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause accounts to terminate their subscriptions, or adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new accounts. Our business would also be harmed if our accounts and potential accounts believe our products or services are unreliable.  If our security measures or those of our third-party cloud data hosts, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to an accounts data, our data or our IT systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure, accounts may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.  As we digitize and use cloud and web-based technologies to leverage account data to deliver a more complete account experience, we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to, or improper use of, our and our accounts information. Certain of our services involve the storage and transmission of accounts proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information,  litigation, and possible liability. Although we devote resources to maintaining our security and integrity, we may not prevent security incidents.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. These threats include but are not limited to identity theft, unauthorized access, domain name system attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, advanced persistent threat, application centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing, backdoor trojans, and distributed denial of service attacks. Any of the foregoing could attack our accounts data  including their employees personal data , our data  including colleagues personal data , or our IT systems. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk. Like all software, our software is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The impact of cyber-attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software solutions or services, cause errors in the output of our accounts work, allow unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information of ours or our accounts, and other destructive outcomes.  Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues or accounts into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords, or other information in order to gain access to our accounts data, our data, or our IT systems. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny accounts access to our services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business, and lead to regulatory inquiry and legal liability.  Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.  Our future success and competitive position depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which provide only limited protection and may not currently or in the future provide us with a competitive advantage. Patents or trademarks may not issue from any of our pending or future patent or trademark applications. Patents or trademarks that do issue from such applications may not give us the protection that we seek, and such patents or trademarks may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. Any patents or trademarks that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent and trademark applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.  The steps we take may not be adequate to protect our technologies and intellectual property, our patent and trademark applications may not lead to issued patents or registered trademarks, others may develop or patent similar or superior technologies or solutions, and our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property may be challenged, invalidated, designed around, or circumvented by others. Furthermore, effective copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our solutions are available or where we do business.  Increasingly stringent and growing data protection and privacy laws with respect to cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions, and other restrictions may apply to our business and non-compliance with such rules may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business.  As a global software and service provider, we collect and process personal data and other data from our users and prospective users. We use this information to provide solutions and applications to our accounts, to validate user identity, to fulfill contractual duties and administer billing and support, to expand and improve our business, and to communicate and recommend products and services through our marketing and advertising efforts. We may also share accounts personal data with certain third parties as described in the privacy policy provided to each account. As a result, we are required to comply with local laws and regulations, including data protection requirements in the countries where we do business.  Globally, new and evolving regulations regarding data protection and privacy and other standards governing the collection, processing, storage, and use of personal data impose additional burdens for us due to increasing  compliance standards that could restrict the use and adoption of our solutions and applications  in particular cloud services .  We have significant business operations in the E.U. and European Economic Area  EEA , where the GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR harmonized data protection regulations across the E.U. and EEA, implementing stringent requirements for the protection of E.U. and EEA individuals  data subjects  personal data. These requirements include expanded requirements for our users as E.U. and EEA data subjects, new obligations on us as data controllers and processors, and mandatory breach notification to affected individuals and data protection supervisory authorities. Non-compliance with GDPR could result in fines and penalties up to the greater of 20 million or 4  of global turnover for the preceding financial year. Moreover, individuals can claim damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. As a result of the GDPR, as a personal data processor for our business-to-business accounts, we must commit to detailed contractual obligations, including to ensure we only process such data on our accounts instructions, keep it secure, require our sub-processors to commit to similar commitments, delete data when the contract ends, and let our accounts audit our compliance.  In addition, E.U. and EEA data protection rules regulate the transfers of E.U. and EEA individuals personal data to other countries that have been deemed by the European Commission not to provide adequate protection to personal data. The United States is not deemed to have adequate laws to protect personal data. We had relied upon the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield program to legitimize certain transfers of personal data from the E.U. and EEA to the United States. However, on July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield program that we  along with thousands of other companies  have used to transfer data from the E.U. and EEA to the United States in compliance with GDPR. As a result of this decision, companies like us that previously relied upon Privacy Shield will be required to use another GDPR-approved method to legitimize transfers of personal data to the U.S. and other third countries in compliance with the GDPR. Until the remaining legal uncertainties regarding how to legally continue these transfers are settled, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. Our accounts may view alternative data transfer mechanisms as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us. For example, some of our accounts or potential accounts in the E.U. may require their vendors to host all personal data within the E.U. and may decide to do business with one of our competitors who hosts personal data within the E.U. instead of doing business with us. This and other future developments regarding the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets and may lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.  Further, laws such as the E.U.s Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002  ePrivacy Directive  and national legislation across the E.U. implementing the ePrivacy Directive and the proposed ePrivacy Regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal data for marketing purposes, and the tracking of individuals online activities. These existing or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions and member states. These and other requirements may have a negative effect on businesses, including ours, that collect and use online usage information for consumer acquisition and marketing. As the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, and as further guidance is issued and interpretation of both the ePrivacy Regulation and GDPR develop, we could incur costs to comply with these regulations.  In addition, despite the enactment of the UK Data Protection Act, which substantially implements the GDPR and became effective in May 2018, it remains unclear exactly how the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the E.U. will affect transborder data flows, regulators jurisdiction over our business, and other matters related to how we do business and how we comply with applicable data protection laws. Accordingly, we cannot predict the additional expense, impact on revenue, or other business impact that may stem from the United Kingdoms withdrawal from the E.U. at this time.  In the Asia-Pacific region, where we have significant business operations, changes in privacy and cybersecurity regulation, some of which is similar to changes effected by the GDPR, have come into effect in 2018 and 2019, and similar significant regulatory changes are expected across the Asia-Pacific region in the future. These changes introduce more stringent requirements, including that we register our data processing activities in certain jurisdictions, appoint local representatives in-country, restrict the cross-border transfer of personal, confidential, and  commercially sensitive information in some cases, provide expanded disclosures to tell our accounts about how we use their personal information, and obtain detailed consents from accounts to processing of personal information. There are also increased rights for accounts to access, control, and delete their personal information. In addition, there are mandatory data breach notification requirements that differ depending on the jurisdiction, as well as increases to penalties and expanded enforcement powers for regulators.  We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security in the United States, the E.U., the EEA, and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations, and standards may have on our business. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act  the CCPA , which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and technology and other industries are considering various new, additional, or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Future laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards, and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information, increase our costs, and impair our ability to maintain and grow our account base and increase our revenue. New laws, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations, and other obligations may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to access, correct, and delete personal data stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal data, and, in some cases, obtain individuals consent to use personal data for certain purposes. If we, or the third parties on which we rely, fail to comply with federal, state, and international data privacy laws and regulations, our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals could be harmed.  Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines and public censure, claims for damages by accounts and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill  both in relation to existing accounts and prospective accounts , any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Around the world, there are numerous lawsuits in process against various technology companies that process personal data. If those lawsuits are successful, it could increase the likelihood that our company may be exposed to liability for our own policies and practices concerning the processing of personal data and could hurt our business.  Our accounts expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties or imposed by the accounts themselves. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain accounts and could harm our business. Further, if we were to experience a breach of systems compromising our accounts sensitive data, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our software solutions and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings.  The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations, and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for them, or lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for any noncompliance.  Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our accounts customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our accounts to use our services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our software solutions or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.  We license third-party technologies for the development of certain of our software solutions, and, in some instances, we incorporate third-party technologies, including open source software, into our software solutions. If we fail to maintain these licenses or are unable to secure alternative licenses on reasonable terms, our business could be adversely affected.  We license third-party technologies to develop certain of our products, and, in some cases, we incorporate third-party technologies into our own software solutions, including technologies owned by our competitors. If we were to seek to expand the scope of this activity in the future, we could be required to obtain additional licenses and enter into long-term arrangements with third parties on whose technology we could become substantially dependent.  If we are unable to use or license these third-party technologies on reasonable terms, including commercially justifiable royalty rates, or if these technologies fail to operate properly or be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced, we may not be able to secure alternatives in a timely manner and our ability to develop and commercialize our own software solutions could be adversely impacted. In addition, licensed technology may be subject to claims that it infringes others intellectual property rights and we may lose access to or have restrictions placed on our use of the licensed technology. We also incorporate open source software into our products. While we have attempted not to use open source code in a manner which could adversely impact our proprietary code, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products.  Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and results of operations.  Vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies in our industry. Although claims of this kind have not materially affected our business to date, there can be no assurance such claims will not arise in the future. Any claims or proceedings against us, regardless of whether meritorious, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation  Recent and potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. government or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products and services and the cost of conducting our business, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Recent and potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. government or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products and services and the cost of conducting our business, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The U.S. government has threatened substantial changes to trade agreements and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China. The imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries, leading to a global trade war. In addition, certain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates, which may also be exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, throughout 2018 and 2019, the United States and China have been levying tariffs on their respective imports. Such tariffs could have a significant impact on our business and the business of our accounts. While we may attempt to renegotiate prices with suppliers or diversify our supply chain in response to tariffs, such efforts may not yield immediate results or may be ineffective. We might also consider increasing prices to the end consumer; however, this could reduce the competitiveness of our products and services and adversely affect revenue. If we fail to manage these dynamics successfully, our gross margins and profitability could be adversely affected.  The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the E.U. may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets, and our business.  The United Kingdoms withdrawal from the E.U.  Brexit  has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the E.U., and this uncertainty may last for years. Despite the implementation  of the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement beginning on January 1, 2021, it is still unclear how Brexit will ultimately impact relationships within the U.K. and between the U.K. and other countries on many aspects of fiscal policy, cross-border trade and international relations. As a result, it is possible that there may be adverse practical or operational implications on our business. Demand for our software solutions or services could be affected by the impact of Brexit. For example, while we have invoiced our U.K.-based accounts and operated our business within the United Kingdom through our U.K.-based subsidiary since the fourth quarter of 2018 to manage risks posed to our business and operations by Brexit, Brexit may cause delays in purchasing decisions by our potential and current accounts affected by this transition and there is considerable uncertainty as to when the long-term nature of the United Kingdoms relationship with the E.U. will be agreed and implemented and what the terms of that relationship will be. The final terms of this exit by the United Kingdom from the E.U. may result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our U.K. and global operations. In addition, our business and our channel partners businesses could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom. The unresolved final terms of Brexit have also created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. For example, the UK Data Protection Act, which substantially implements the GDPR, became effective in May 2018. It remains unclear, however, how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop and be interpreted in the medium to longer term, how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated, and how those regulations may differ from those in the E.U. Further, the United Kingdoms exit from the E.U. may create increased compliance costs and an uncertain regulatory landscape for offering equity-based incentives to our employees in the United Kingdom. If we are unable to maintain equity-based incentive programs for our employees in the United Kingdom due to the departure of the United Kingdom from the E.U., our business in the United Kingdom may suffer and we may face legal claims from employees in the United Kingdom to whom we previously offered equity-based incentive programs.  We are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries, and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future, any of which may be costly, distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome, or harm on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the trading price for our securities.  We are subject to various investigations, claims, and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including commercial disputes, labor and employment matters, tax audits, alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, and other matters. As the global economy has changed, our industry has seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries. Like many other high technology companies, on a regular and ongoing basis, we receive inquiries from U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies regarding our business and our business practices, and the business practices of others in our industry. In the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes. Any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, could result in expensive costs of defense, costly damage awards, injunctive relief, increased costs of business, fines or orders to change certain business practices, significant dedication of management time, diversion of significant operational resources, or otherwise harm our business. In any of these cases, our financial results could be negatively impacted.  Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act  FCPA  and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws associated with our activities outside the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.  The majority of our revenues are from jurisdictions outside of the United States. We are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing, obtaining, or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies and individuals alike, including company directors, officers, employees, and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners, or other representatives. In addition, the government may seek to rely on a theory of successor liability and hold us responsible for FCPA violations committed by companies or associated with assets that we acquire.  We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.  Our offerings may be subject to U.S. export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that restrict the delivery of our solutions and services to certain locations, governments, and persons. While we have processes in place to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws, including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against U.S. government lists of restricted and prohibited persons, we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws. We may also decide to acquire companies whose past activities could give rise to potential liability under export control and sanctions laws. Such acquisitions may require substantial time and resources to integrate the acquired company into our compliance processes, to correct potential compliance gaps, and to remediate past potential violations by the acquired company, including through our own internal actions, voluntary self-disclosures, or other measures.  Further, if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, for example, through reputational harm, as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.  Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control laws can result in fines, penalties, denial of export and trading privileges, and seizure of goods and assets. Other consequences include negative publicity and harm to business reputation, increased government scrutiny  including intrusive audits, and increased difficulty obtaining government licenses and approvals , and or remedial compliance measures as a condition of settling government charges.  We may face exposure to product or professional liability claims that could cause us to be liable for damages.  The use of our software could lead to the filing of product liability claims against us were someone to allege that our software provided inaccurate or incomplete information at any stage of the infrastructure lifecycle or otherwise failed to perform according to specifications. In the event that accounts or third parties sustain property damage, injury, death, or other loss in connection with their use of our software or infrastructure for which our software solutions and services were used to engineer, we, along with others, may be sued, and whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable, we may incur significant legal expenses, managements attention could be diverted from operations, and market acceptance of our software could decrease. Our risk of exposure to litigation in these situations could rise as our software solutions and services are used for increasingly complex and high-profile infrastructure projects. Litigation could also impair our ability to obtain professional liability or product liability insurance or increase the cost of such insurance. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time.  The limitations of our liability included in our contracts with accounts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Additionally, we may be subject to claims that are not explicitly covered by contract, such as a claim directly by a third party. There is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover incurred liabilities or that we will be able to obtain acceptable product and professional liability coverage in the future.  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness  Our credit agreement, as amended, contains restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility, and certain changes in ownership of equity interests in us by the Bentley Family, as defined, constitutes an event of default.  Our amended and restated credit agreement, entered into on December 19, 2017  the Credit Facility , contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur indebtedness other than amounts under the Credit Facility and specified baskets, incur additional liens, merge or consolidate with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, enter into new lines of business, pay dividends to our stockholders, make investments in and acquire other businesses, and transfer or dispose of assets. In certain circumstances, the agreement governing the Credit Facility may also limit our ability to transfer cash among our subsidiaries and  between us and our subsidiaries, including our foreign subsidiaries. It also contains certain financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us not to permit the net leverage ratio to exceed 3.50 to 1.00 and a covenant requiring the fixed charge coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to not be less than 3.00 to 1.00, and financial reporting requirements. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our U.S. assets and 65  of the stock of our foreign subsidiaries owned by a party to the agreement governing the Credit Facility.  Further, if the Bentley Family ceases to collectively own equity interests in us representing at least 20  of the aggregate voting power of the Company, then such change in ownership will be an event of default under the agreement governing the Credit Facility and, among other things, the commitments under the Credit Facility may be terminated immediately and the outstanding loans and accrued interest may become due and payable immediately.  In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or revenues to meet these financial covenants or pay the principal and interest on any debt. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings, or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any debt. Any inability to make scheduled payments or meet the financial covenants in the agreement governing the Credit Facility would adversely affect our business.  The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under our Credit Facility.  In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA   the authority that regulates LIBOR  announced it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Further, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited  ICE  announced its plan to extend the date that most USD-LIBOR values would cease being computed to June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee  ARRC  and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association  ISDA  have identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate  SOFR  as its preferred alternative rate for USD-LIBOR in debt, derivatives, and other financial contracts. LIBOR is used as the reference rate for Euro currency borrowings under our Credit Facility and as one of the alternatives for U.S. Dollar borrowings under our Credit Facility. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the administration agent under our Credit Facility has the authority to select a benchmark replacement index and adjustment margins and, as such, the interest rate on Euro currency borrowings under our Credit Facility may change. The new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. Furthermore, the transition process may result in delays in funding, higher interest expense, additional expenses, and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR, all of which could negatively impact our interest expense, results of operations, and cash flow. Even if financial instruments are transitioned to alternative benchmarks, such as SOFR, successfully, the new benchmarks are likely to differ from LIBOR, and our interest expense associated with our outstanding indebtedness or any future indebtedness we incur may increase. Further, transitioning to an alternative benchmark rate, such as SOFR, may result in us incurring significant expense and legal risks, as renegotiation and changes to documentation may be required in effecting the transition. Any alternative benchmark rate may be calculated differently than LIBOR and may increase the interest expense associated with our existing or future indebtedness.  We may incur substantial additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.  We may incur additional debt in the future. Although the agreement governing the Credit Facility contains restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions which permit us and our subsidiaries to incur substantial debt. Adding new debt to current debt levels could intensify the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face. See the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources included in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.  Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required  to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any future indebtedness we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital, or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.  Risks Related to Our Class B Common Stock  We issued convertible notes that have rights senior to our Class B Common Stock.  In January 2021, we issued  690 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2026  the 2026 Notes , which will mature on January 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. The 2026 Notes rank senior in right of payment to our Class B Common Stock and any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities  including trade payables  of our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the 2026 Notes will be available to pay obligations on the 2026 Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full from these assets, and our assets will be available to pay common stockholders only after all debt obligations have been repaid. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the 2026 Notes then outstanding or any or all shares of our Class B Common Stock then outstanding.  The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2026 Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial condition and results.  The accounting method for reflecting the 2026 Notes on our consolidated balance sheet and reflecting the underlying shares of our Class B Common Stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.  In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options  Subtopic 470-20  and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity  Subtopic 815-40   Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity  ASU 2020-06 . ASU 2020-06 will be effective for SEC-reporting entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021  or, in the case of smaller reporting companies, December 15, 2023 , including interim periods within those fiscal years. However, early adoption is permitted in certain circumstances for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. On January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06. In accordance with ASU 2020-06, we are required to calculate diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share will be calculated assuming that all the 2026 Notes are converted solely into shares of Class B Common Stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method will reduce our reported diluted earnings per share.  Furthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the 2026 Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the 2026 Notes as a current, rather than long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.  The conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  In the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2026 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2026 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to  convert their 2026 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class B Common Stock  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2026 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Notes as a current, rather than long-term, liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  Conversion of the 2026 Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their 2026 Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our Class B Common Stock.  The conversion of some or all of the convertible 2026 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the 2026 Notes. Any sales in the public market of the Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class B Common Stock. In addition, the existence of the 2026 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2026 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2026 Notes into shares of our Class B Common Stock could depress the price of our Class B Common Stock. As of December 31, 2020, without giving effect to any potential adjustments to the conversion rate set forth in the indenture or any limits on conversion, and assuming our Class B Common Stock is trading at or above  64.13 per share, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon a full conversion of the notes is 10,759,395.  The capped call transactions entered into when we issued the 2026 Notes may affect the value of our common stock.  In connection with the issuances of the 2026 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions with the respective option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2026 Notes and or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2026 Notes with such reduction and or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class B Common Stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the 2026 Notes. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding derivatives with respect to our Class B Common Stock and or purchasing or selling our Class B Common Stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2026 Notes  and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2026 Notes . This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class B Common Stock.  The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with the Bentley Control Group, as defined.  Our Class A Common Stock has 29 votes per share, and our Class B Common Stock, which is the class of common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the 2026 Notes and is the only class that is publicly traded and listed, has one vote per share. The beneficial owners of our Class A Common Stock together hold approximately 56.6  of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020. Moreover, as a result of the 29 to one voting ratio between our Class A and Class B Common Stock, the Bentley Control Group controls and will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, subject to the occurrence of certain events that would reduce the voting power of our Class A Common Stock or cause the conversion thereof. This concentrated control will limit or preclude stockholders ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future and may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders. The Bentley Control Group may also have interests that differ from those of other stockholders and may vote in a way with which other stockholders disagree and which may be adverse to such other stockholders interests.  In addition, we are a controlled company for the purposes of Nasdaq Listing Rules, which provides us with exemptions from certain of the corporate governance standards imposed by the rules of The Nasdaq Global Select Market. These provisions further allow the Bentley Control Group to exercise significant control over our corporate decisions and limit the ability of the public stockholders to influence our decision making.  The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or colleagues.  Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws, or any action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated by-laws, and any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, the choice of forum provision provides that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, claims brought under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act must be brought exclusively in the federal district court for the District of Delaware. Despite the choice of forum provision, investors cannot waive compliance with federal securities laws and rules and regulations thereunder. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other colleagues, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other colleagues. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.  General Risk Factors  Global economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Our operations and performance depend significantly on foreign and domestic economic conditions. Uncertainty regarding economic conditions may negatively impact us as accounts defer spending or postpone infrastructure projects in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, escalations of hostilities or the threat of hostilities, pandemics, declining valuations of investments, and other factors. In addition, certain of our accounts budgets may be constrained and they may be unable to procure our solutions at the same level as in prior periods. Our accounts ability to pay for our software solutions and services may also be impaired, which may lead to an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable. Since we are exposed to the majority of major world markets, uncertainty in any significant market may negatively impact our performance and results, particularly with respect to our largest geographic accounts. Our accounts include government entities, including the U.S. government, and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services, our revenues could decline. In addition, a number of our accounts rely, directly and indirectly, on government spending. We are unable to predict economic conditions or the likelihood of additional economic uncertainty arising in any of our key markets. Changes in economic conditions could result in us not meeting our revenue growth objectives and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of, or otherwise interfere with, conducting our business. These trends have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets; the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain. Political instability or adverse political developments, including, without limitation, as a result of or in connection with trade relations between the United States and China, in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations."}

Overview    We are a leading global provider of software for infrastructure engineering, enabling the work of civil, structural, geotechnical, and plant engineering practitioners, their project delivery enterprises, and owner-operators of infrastructure assets. We were founded in 1984 by the Bentley brothers and on September 25, 2020, we completed our IPO.  Our enduring commitment is to develop and support the most comprehensive portfolio of integrated software offerings across professional disciplines, project and asset lifecycles, infrastructure sectors, and geographies. Our software enables digital workflows across engineering disciplines, distributed project teams, from offices to the field, and across computing form factors, including desktops, on-premises servers, cloud-native services, mobile devices, and web browsers. We deliver our solutions via on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments. Our users engineer, construct, and operate projects and assets across the following infrastructure sectors   public works  including roads, rail, airports, ports, and water and wastewater networks  utilities  including electric, gas, water, and communications . We estimate that this sector represents 51  of the net infrastructure asset value of the global top 500 infrastructure owners based on the 2020 edition of the Bentley Infrastructure 500 Top Owners, our annual compilation of the worlds largest infrastructure owners ranked by net depreciated value of their tangible fixed assets;  industrial  including discrete and process manufacturing, power generation, and water treatment plants  resources  including oil and gas, mining, and offshore . We estimate that this sector represents 37  of the global top 500 infrastructure owners net infrastructure asset value; and  commercial facilities  including office buildings, hospitals, and campuses . We estimate that this sector represents 12  of the global top 500 infrastructure owners net infrastructure asset value.  We offer solutions for enterprises and professionals across the infrastructure lifecycle. Our Project Delivery and Asset and Network Performance solutions are systems provided via cloud and hybrid environments, developed respectively to extend enterprise collaboration during project delivery, and to manage and leverage engineering information during operations and maintenance. Our Design Integration and Digital Cities solutions are primarily desktop applications and cloud-provisioned solutions for professional practitioners and workgroups.  We continue to make substantial investments in research and development because we believe the infrastructure engineering software market presents compelling opportunities for the application of new technologies that advance our current solutions. Our research and development roadmap balances technology advances and new offerings with continuous enhancements to existing offerings. Our allocation of research and development resources is guided by management-established priorities, input from product managers, and user and sales force feedback.  We bring our offerings to market primarily through direct sales channels that generated approximately 92  of our 2020 revenues.  Since its founding, Bentley Systems has remained focused on our mission to provide software in support of the professional needs of those responsible for creating and managing the worlds infrastructure. We have methodically grown through periods of global expansion, periods of expansion in our portfolio of solutions, and periods of rapid technological change. The following provides key corporate milestones over our 36-year history   Our sources of revenue growth, in order of magnitude, come from the recurrence of existing subscription revenues, additional revenue and growth from existing accounts using the same products, additional revenue and growth from existing accounts using new products, and growth from new accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, under Topic 6061, subscriptions represented 85  of our revenues, and together with certain professional services revenues that are recurring in nature and represented 2  of our revenues, bring the proportion of our recurring revenues to 87  of total revenues. The remaining 13  of our revenues were generated from the sale of perpetual licenses and the delivery of non-recurring professional services. We have a highly-diversified account base, with our largest account representing no more than 2.5  of total revenues in 2020. Our 2020 revenues were also diversified by account type, size, and geography. Additionally, we believe that we have a loyal account base, with 80  of our 2020 revenues from organizations that have been our accounts for over ten years. Between 2000 and 2020, our revenues had an approximately 8  compound annual growth rate.  1 On January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and related amendments  Topic 606 , which superseded the guidance provided by Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, and Topic 605-25, Revenue Recognition, Multiple-Element Arrangements. We refer to ASC 985-605 and Topic 605-25 collectively as Topic 605. We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method and applied the standard only to contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial application. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact upon adoption of Topic 606 as of January 1, 2019.  Our Commercial Offerings   Our solutions are made available to our accounts in a broad range of commercial offerings designed to accommodate the diverse preferences of our accounts, which range from owned versus subscribed, short-term subscriptions versus longer term annual subscriptions, and fee-certain arrangements versus variable or consumption-based arrangements with consumption measurement durations of less than one year. We contract our commercial offerings under a single form of standard contract, which includes liability and other risk protections in our favor, and appropriate standard addendums to the primary contract, which specifically address the commercial offerings provided. Our standard commercial offerings are summarized in the below table, with further descriptions following the table   SELECT Subscriptions. Our SELECT subscription is a prepaid annual recurring subscription that accompanies a new or previously purchased perpetual license. We believe that the SELECT benefits summarized below support our favorable rates of account retention and growth   Software upgrades;  Comprehensive technical support;  License pooling providing accounts with efficiency advantages;  Portfolio balancing providing accounts the opportunity to exchange unused or under used licenses with other of our license offerings;  Learning benefits, Azure-based cloud collaboration services, and mobility advantages; and  Access to our entire application portfolio with usage of licenses not previously purchased monetized quarterly in arrears based on consumption. See the section titled -Term License Subscriptions below.  Enterprise Subscriptions. Our Enterprise subscription offerings provide our largest accounts with complete and unlimited global access to our comprehensive portfolio of solutions.  Enterprise License Subscriptions  ELS . Our ELS offering provides access to our comprehensive portfolio of solutions for a fixed annual fee. Subsequent annual renewals are based on the accounts usage of software in the preceding year, effectively resulting in an annual consumption-based arrangement. The majority of our ELS subscribers were historically SELECT subscribers that have grown into a position to take full advantage of our ELS offering.  Enterprise 365  E365  Subscriptions. Under our E365 subscription, participating accounts have unrestricted access to our comprehensive software portfolio, similar to ELS, however they are charged based upon daily usage. The daily usage fee also includes a term license component, SELECT maintenance and support, hosting, and Success Plan services, which are designed to achieve business outcomes through more efficient and effective use of our software. The E365 subscription offering was introduced in 2018. Prospectively, we plan to prioritize efforts to transition ELS subscribers to E365 subscriptions, primarily to simplify pricing, more closely align consumption to monetization, and to establish Success Plan services as recurring to ensure better business outcomes for our users. To the extent we succeed in transitioning subscribers to E365, under Topic 606 we would recognize a greater proportion of our revenues on a quarterly basis rather than substantially upfront. See the section titled -Key Factors Impacting Comparability and Performance.  Term License Subscriptions  Annual Term Licenses  ATL  Subscription. Annual term licenses are generally prepaid annually for named user access to specific products and include our newly introduced Practitioner Licenses. ATL are also used to monetize site or enterprise wide access for certain of our AssetWise solutions within given usage bands.  Quarterly Term License  QTL  Subscription. Through quarterly term licenses, accounts pay quarterly in arrears for licenses they have used representing usage beyond their contracted quantities. Much like our Enterprise subscription programs, a QTL allows smaller and medium-sized accounts to match usage to ongoing project requirements.  Monthly Term License  MTL  Subscription. Monthly term licenses are identical to QTL subscriptions, except for the term of the license, and the manner in which they are monetized. MTL subscriptions require a Cloud Services Subscription, which is discussed below.  Visas and Passports. Visas and Passports are quarterly or annual term licenses enabling users to access specific project or enterprise information and entitles our users to certain functionality of our ProjectWise and AssetWise systems. Generally, a Passport provides desktop, web, and mobile application access to project information and certain functions, and a Visa provides similar access, plus added functionality depending upon the product to which the Visa is aligned.  While certain legacy arrangements are supported, our standard offering requires Visas and Passports to be fulfilled and contracted via a CSS, which is discussed below.  Cloud Services Subscription  CSS . CSS is designed to streamline the procurement, administration, and payment process for us and our accounts. A CSS requires an upfront annual estimation of MTL, Visa and Passport consumption, and any Success Plan services expected for the upcoming year. A deposit for the annual estimated consumption is submitted in advance. Actual consumption is monitored and invoiced against the deposit on a calendar quarter basis. Accounts are charged only for what gets used and deposited amounts never expire.  Perpetual Licenses  We historically have sold perpetual licenses and continue to offer them to our accounts as an available option for most of our applications. Perpetual licenses are available for accounts that prefer to own their software licenses and may be sold with or without attaching a SELECT subscription. Historically, attachment and retention of the SELECT subscription has been high given the benefits of the SELECT subscription.  Professional Services  We offer professional services, including training, implementation, configuration, customization, and strategic consulting services for all types of projects as requested by our accounts. We perform projects on both a time and materials and a fixed fee basis. We also offer our services using contractual structures based on  i  delivery of the services in the form of subscription-like, packaged offerings that are annually recurring in nature; and  ii  delivery of our growing portfolio of Success Plans in standard offerings that offer a level of subscription service over and above the standard technical support offered to all accounts as part of their SELECT or Enterprise agreement. Over time, we expect professional services revenues using subscription and subscription-like contractual structures to make up a greater proportion of our professional services revenues.  Key Business Metrics   We regularly review the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.  Year Ended December 31,  2020 2019 2018  Last twelve-months recurring revenues  Topic 606    696,662   631,097   586,466  Last twelve-months recurring revenues  Topic 605    700,406   636,899   583,402  Constant Currency   Annualized recurring revenues  ARR  growth rate 8   12   10    Account retention rate  Topic 606  98    Account retention rate  Topic 605  98   98   98    Recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate  Topic 606  107    Recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate  Topic 605  108   108   107    Last twelve-months recurring revenues. Last twelve-months recurring revenues is calculated as recurring revenues recognized over the preceding twelve-month period. We define recurring revenues as subscriptions revenues that recur monthly, quarterly, or annually with specific or automatic renewal clauses and professional services revenues in which the underlying contract is based on a fixed fee and contains automatic annual renewal provisions.  Last twelve-months recurring revenues is presented using revenues recognized pursuant to Topic 606, as well as Topic 605, for all periods in order to enhance comparability during our transition to Topic 606. The Topic 606 unaudited amount presented for the year ended December 31, 2018 gives effect to revenue adjustments as if the adoption of Topic 606 had occurred as of January 1, 2018 rather than January 1, 2019. For a reconciliation of the impact of adopting Topic 606 as if it had occurred as of January 1, 2018 on our audited consolidated statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018, see the section titled -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  On an annual and trailing twelve-month basis, we expect our recurring revenues recognized under Topic 606 to be comparable to such revenues recognized under Topic 605. This expectation is attributable to the annual, recurring nature of our subscription agreements. However, under Topic 606, the conversion of our existing subscription users to consumption-based offerings with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, such as our E365 subscription offering, as well as the term start date of new annual term license subscriptions, does introduce some volatility between annual and trailing twelve-month periods and impact period over period comparability. Specifically, in 2019, the conversion of existing ELS subscriptions to consumption-based E365 subscriptions resulted in a reduction of Topic 606 Enterprise subscriptions revenues of  11,248 when compared to Topic 605. This impact was partially offset by higher annual term license subscriptions revenues under Topic 606 of  5,714 due to the upfront recognition of license revenues of new subscriptions. See the section titled -Key Factors Impacting Comparability and Performance.  We believe that last twelve-months recurring revenues is an important indicator of our performance during the immediately preceding twelve-month time period. We believe that we will continue to experience favorable growth in recurring revenues due to our strong account retention and recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rates, as well as the addition of new accounts with recurring revenues. The last twelve-months recurring revenues under Topic 606 for the periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 compared to the last twelve-months of the preceding twelve-month period increased by  65,565  or  63,507 under Topic 605 ,  44,631  or  53,497 under Topic 605 , and  64,543  or  59,900 under Topic 605 , respectively. The increase was primarily due to growth in ARR, which is primarily the result of consistent performance in our account retention rate and in our recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate, as well as additional recurring revenues resulting from new accounts and acquisitions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 87  of our revenues under Topic 606 were recurring revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 86  of our revenues under Topic 606  or 87  under Topic 605  were recurring revenues.  Constant currency metrics. In reporting period-over-period results, we calculate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information by translating current period results using prior period average foreign currency exchange rates. Our definition of constant currency may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and these constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America  U.S. GAAP .  ARR growth rate. Our ARR growth rate is the growth rate of our ARR, measured on a constant currency basis. Our ARR is defined as the sum of the annualized value of our portfolio of contracts that produce recurring revenue as of the last day of the reporting period, and the annualized value of the last three months of recognized revenues for our contractually recurring consumption-based software subscriptions with consumption measurement durations of less than one year. We believe that the last three months of recognized revenues, on an annualized basis, for our recurring software subscriptions with consumption measurement period durations of less than one year is a reasonable estimate of the annual revenues, given our consistently high retention rate and stability of usage under such subscriptions. ARR resulting from the annualization of recurring contracts with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, as a percentage of total ARR, was 36 , 25 , and 15  as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Within our consumption-measured ARR, the successful uptake of our new E365 subscription offering has introduced daily consumption-measured ARR, representing 25  of total ARR as of December 31, 2020. ARR is inclusive of the ARR of acquired companies as of the date they are acquired. We believe that ARR and ARR growth are important metrics indicating the scale and growth of our business. Furthermore, we believe ARR, considered in connection with our account retention rate and our recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate, is a leading indicator of revenue growth. Our ARR as of December 31, 2020 was  752,697, calculated using the spot foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2020.  Our ARR growth rate was favorably impacted from acquisitions by 1  for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and 3  for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Account retention rate. Our account retention rate for any given twelve-month period is calculated using the average currency exchange rates for the prior period, as follows  the prior period recurring revenues from all accounts with recurring revenues in the current and prior period, divided by total recurring revenues from all accounts during the prior period. The account retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was calculated under Topic 606 and continues to be presented pursuant to Topic 605 for comparability purposes. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2020, the account retention rate was calculated using revenues recognized pursuant to Topic 605 for all periods in order to enhance comparability during our transition to Topic 606 as we did not have all information that was necessary to calculate account retention rate pursuant to Topic 606 for earlier periods. Our account retention rate is an important indicator that provides insight into the long-term value of our account relationships and our ability to retain our account base. We believe that our consistent and high account retention rates illustrate our ability to retain and cultivate long-term relationships with our accounts.  Recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate. Our recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate is calculated using the average exchange rates for the prior period, as follows  the recurring revenues for the current period, including any growth or reductions from existing accounts, but excluding recurring revenues from any new accounts added during the current period, divided by the total recurring revenues from all accounts during the prior period. A period is defined as any trailing twelve months. The recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was calculated under Topic 606 and continues to be presented pursuant to Topic 605 for comparability purposes. Prior to the year ended December 31, 2020, the recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate was calculated using revenues recognized pursuant to Topic 605 for all periods in order to enhance comparability during our transition to Topic 606 as we did not have all information that was necessary to calculate recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate pursuant to Topic 606 for earlier periods. We believe our recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate is a key indicator of our success in growing our revenues within our existing accounts. Given that recurring revenues represented 87  of our total revenues under Topic 606 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, this metric helps explain our revenue performance as primarily growth into existing accounts. We believe that our consistent and high recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate illustrates our ability to consistently retain accounts and grow them.  As discussed above, we expect annual and trailing twelve-month recurring revenues recognized under Topic 606 to be comparable to such revenues recognized under Topic 605 due to the annual, recurring nature of our subscription agreements. We, therefore, also expect, that our account retention rate and our recurring revenue dollar-based net retention rate under Topic 606 will remain comparable to such metrics under Topic 605. However, under Topic 606, the conversion of our existing subscription users to consumption-based offerings with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, such as our E365 subscription offering, as well as the term start date of new subscriptions, does introduce some volatility between annual, and trailing twelve-month periods and impact period over period comparability. See the section titled -Key Factors Impacting Comparability and Performance.  Our calculation of these metrics may not be comparable to other companies with similarly-titled metrics.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures   In addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also use the below non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  Year Ended December 31,  2020 2019 2018  Topic 606  1    Adjusted EBITDA   266,199   188,129   171,120  Adjusted Net Income   192,678   135,049   131,697  Topic 605  2    Adjusted EBITDA   186,598   171,768  Adjusted Net Income   135,471   132,246   1 The Topic 606 unaudited amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2018 give effect to revenue adjustments as if the adoption of Topic 606 had occurred as of January 1, 2018 rather than January 1, 2019.   2 The Topic 605 amounts presented for the year ended December 31, 2019 give effect to revenue adjustments as if the adoption of Topic 606 had not occurred on January 1, 2019. For a reconciliation of the impact of adopting Topic 606 on our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.  Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, net, provision  benefit  for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition expenses, realignment expenses, expenses associated with IPO, other non-operating  income  and expense, net, and  income  loss from investment accounted for using the equity method, net of tax.  Adjusted Net Income. We define Adjusted Net Income as net income adjusted for the following  amortization of purchased intangibles and developed technologies, stock-based compensation, acquisition expenses, realignment expenses, expenses associated with IPO, other non-operating income and expense, net, the tax effect of the above adjustments to net income, non-recurring income tax expense and benefit, and  income  loss from investment accounted for using the equity method, net of tax. The tax effect of adjustments to net income is based on the estimated marginal effective tax rates in the jurisdictions impacted by such adjustments.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not presentations made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our use of the terms Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may vary from the use of similarly titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-GAAP financial information is viewed with U.S. GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to compare our results to those of our competitors and to consistently measure our performance from period to period.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

The most significant impact from the adoption of Topic 606 relates to timing of revenue recognition for perpetual licenses and the accounting for certain of our subscription arrangements that include term-based software licenses bundled with support. Under prior guidance, revenue for perpetual licenses was recognized over a three-year period, while revenue attributable to the term-based software licenses was recognized ratably over the term. Under Topic 606, both perpetual license and prepaid term-based software license revenue is recognized upfront upon delivery of the software license. Our revenue recognition for services, as well as our accounting for costs to obtain a contract with a customer, remained substantially unchanged and were not adjusted. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of Topic 606.  Reconciliation of Topic 605 to Topic 606   Year Ended December 31, 2018  Impact from  the Adoption of  As Reported Topics 606 As Adjusted  Topic 605 and 340-40 Topic 606  Subscriptions   557,421   3,064   560,485  Perpetual licenses 61,065  3,712  57,353  Benefit for income taxes 29,250 99 29,349  Net income    142,112    549    141,563   2 The Topic 605 unaudited amounts presented for the years ended December 31, 2019 give effect to revenue adjustments as if the adoption of Topic 606 had not occurred on January 1, 2019. For a reconciliation of the impact of adopting Topic 606 on our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.   3 Further explanation of certain of our adjustments in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are as follows    a Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes amortization of  4,699,  3,516, and  2,052 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, related to certain projects under our Accelerated Commercial Development Program  ACDP .   b Amortization of purchased intangibles and developed technologies. Amortization of purchased intangibles varies in amount and frequency and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Amortization of acquisition related developed technologies under our ACDP was  388,  723, and  375 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. The use of intangible assets and developed technologies contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will also contribute to our revenues in future periods. Amortization of purchased intangible assets and developed technologies will recur in future periods.   c Stock-based compensation. We exclude certain stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non-cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business results of operations and those of other companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded  15,102 of stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock and RSUs that vested as a result of the IPO.   d Acquisition expenses. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our U.S. GAAP presentation of general and administrative expense. Also included in our acquisition expenses are retention incentives paid to executives of the acquired companies, as well as adjustments related to deferred revenue from acquired companies. We exclude these acquisition expenses when we evaluate our continuing operational performance as we would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations. Acquired deferred revenue is recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that typically is lower than historical carrying value. The adjustment to acquired deferred revenue has no impact on our business or cash flow, but it does reduce reported U.S. GAAP revenue in the periods following an acquisition.   e Realignment expenses. These expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies to better serve our accounts and to better align resources with the evolving needs of the business. In connection with these actions, we recognize costs related to termination benefits for colleagues whose positions were eliminated. We exclude these charges because they are not reflective of our ongoing business and results of operations. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses. In the ordinary course of operating our business, we incur severance expenses that are not included in this adjustment.   f Expenses associated with IPO. These expenses included certain non-recurring costs relating to our IPO, consisting of the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the sale of shares by the selling stockholders, professional fees, and other expenses. We exclude these charges because they are not reflective of our ongoing business and results of operations. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.   g Other  income  expense, net. Primarily consists of foreign exchange  gains  losses of   22,919 ,  5,591, and  418 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The foreign exchange  gains  losses derive primarily from U.S. Dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and intercompany balances held by foreign subsidiaries. In October 2018, we had intercompany sales of certain intangible operating assets between our foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in significant U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany liabilities at foreign subsidiaries with a non-U.S. Dollar functional currency  mainly Euro . These U.S. Dollar denominated balances are being translated into their functional currencies at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date and are fully eliminated in consolidation. The gains and losses from such translations are included in Other income  expense , net in the consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany finance transactions denominated in U.S. Dollars resulted in unrealized foreign exchange  gains  losses of   22,310  and  5,270 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other  income  expense, net also includes a gain from the change in fair value of our interest rate swap of  347 and a gain from the change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration of  1,340 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We exclude these charges because they are not reflective of ongoing business and results of operations. We believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses.   h Non-recurring income tax expense related to the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and resulted in a provisional income tax expense of  30,273 in 2017 primarily due to the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings and deferred tax impacts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a  4,318 increase to income tax expense related to provisional amounts recorded in 2017.   i Non-recurring income tax benefit related to intercompany transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had intercompany sales of certain intangible operating assets between our foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a non-recurring net tax benefit of  46,369.  Key Factors Impacting Comparability and Performance   Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to our performance previously discussed in -Key Business Metrics and -Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and as discussed further below in -Results of Operations and -Liquidity and Capital Resources, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the following   On September 25, 2020, we completed our IPO. The selling stockholders sold 12,360,991 shares of Class B Common Stock at a public offering price of  22.00 per share. The Company did not sell any shares in the IPO and did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the Class B Common Stock sold by the selling stockholders;  On November 17, 2020, we completed our follow-on public offering of 11,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock at a public offering price of  32.00 per share. We sold 9,603,965 shares of Class B Common Stock  inclusive of 1,500,000 shares sold upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of our Class B Common Stock . The selling stockholders sold 1,896,035 shares of Class B Common Stock. We received net proceeds of  294,429 after deducting expenses of  12,898. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the Class B Common Stock sold by the selling stockholders;  On August 28, 2020, our board of directors declared the Special Dividend of  1.50 per share of our common stock   392,489 in the aggregate ;  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded  15,102 of stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock and RSUs that vested as a result of the IPO;  During the third quarter of 2020, we initiated a strategic realignment program in order to better serve our users and to better align resources with the evolving needs of our business  the 2020 Program . We incurred realignment costs of  10,046 for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the aforementioned program, which represents termination benefits for colleagues whose positions were eliminated;  On March 31, 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of  200,000 and a ten-year term to reduce the interest rate risk associated with our Credit Facility;  Effective as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2020, participants in our Executive Bonus Plan may elect to receive any portion, or all, of such participants non-deferred incentive bonus in the form of shares of fully vested Class B Common Stock instead of cash payments and subject to a combined quarterly limit of  7,500. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded  6,524 of stock-based compensation expense related to this plan; and  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a modest impact on the usage of our solutions by our users. Throughout 2020, usage rates as compared to comparable periods in the prior year have fluctuated between modest increases to modest decreases. Usage declines have had a minimal impact on our recurring revenues, which are comprised primarily of longer term contracts where short-term usage rate declines do not adversely impact revenues. However, to the extent declines in usage have also occurred within our recurring revenue contracts with shorter term resets, as is the case with our E365 contracts, the usage declines have modestly impacted revenues. The growth of our revenues from perpetual licenses and professional services has also been impacted as certain accounts have shifted spend to subscription solutions or delayed new projects. Overall, while our rate of growth has been impacted, our revenues have continued to grow given the mission critical nature of our solutions. As a precaution in the COVID-19 environment, we have actively managed our spending. Actions have included efforts to minimize employee travel, curtail variable compensation plans, and reduce and recharacterize promotional spending with a shift to virtual events. These actions have resulted in substantial cost savings during the pandemic, which are unlikely to be fully sustainable prospectively.  Impact of Topics 606 and 340-40. On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 606, which superseded substantially all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We adopted Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 was recorded as a reduction to the opening balance of Accumulated deficit of  125,464   101,489, net of tax  as of January 1, 2019. We applied the standard only to contracts that were not completed as of the date of initial application. The comparative information for the year ended December 31, 2018 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605.  The most significant impact from the adoption of Topic 606 relates to timing of revenue recognition for perpetual licenses and the accounting for certain of our subscription arrangements that include term-based software licenses bundled with support. Under Topic 605, revenue for perpetual licenses was recognized over a three-year period, while revenue attributable to the term-based software licenses was recognized ratably over the term. Under Topic 606, both perpetual license and prepaid term-based software license revenue is recognized upfront upon delivery of the software license. Revenue recognition related to support, hosting, usage-based offerings, and services is substantially unchanged, with support and hosting revenue recorded ratably over the contract term, usage-based revenue recognized upon usage or delivery, and services revenue as delivered.  On an annual and trailing twelve-month basis, we expect our subscriptions revenues recognized under Topic 606 to be comparable to such revenues recognized under Topic 605. This expectation is attributable to the annual, recurring nature of our subscription agreements. However, quarterly subscription revenue and profitability trends will be impacted by the subscription term as well as the term start date of new and renewals subscriptions, due to the upfront revenue recognition of the associated term-license component.  Under Topic 605, our perpetual licenses revenues were recognized over a three-year period due to the portfolio balancing feature users obtain through their SELECT subscriptions. Under Topic 606, our perpetual licenses revenues are recognized upon delivery and will closely align with the respective license sales of the period.  Further, under Topic 606, the conversion of our existing subscription users to consumption-based offerings with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, such as our E365 subscription offering, does introduce some volatility between annual, quarterly, and trailing twelve-month periods and impact period over period comparability. This effect is because the term-based software license is recognized upfront upon delivery for prepaid subscription-based offerings, but upon usage for consumption-based offerings. For example, if an account renewed an annual ELS at the beginning of July 2019, then we would recognize in 2019 the term-based software license of the annual subscription upon renewal for the twelve-month period from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. However, if such account instead switched from our ELS offering to our consumption based E365 offering, then we would only recognize the distinct license component for the consumption period from July 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 in 2019.  See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact upon adoption of Topics 606 and 340-40 as of January 1, 2019.  Impact of foreign currency. A portion of our revenues and operating expenses were derived from outside the United States and as such, were denominated in various foreign currencies, including most significantly  Euros, British Pounds, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, and Chinese Yuan Renminbi. Our financial results are therefore affected by changes in foreign currency rates. In 2020, 43  of our revenues were denominated in various foreign currencies. Correspondingly, in 2020, 47  of our operating expenses were denominated in various foreign currencies. Other than the natural hedge attributable to matching revenues and expenses in the same currencies, we do not currently hedge foreign currency exposure. Accordingly, our results of operations have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.  We identify the effects of foreign currency on our operations and present constant currency growth rates and fluctuations because we believe exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons and enhance the understanding of our results and evaluation of our performance. In reporting period to period results, we calculate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and constant currency information by translating current period results using prior period average foreign currency exchange rates. Our definition of constant currency may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and these constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Acquisitions. Historically, we have enhanced our business with acquisitions of businesses, software solutions, and technologies. Going forward, we plan to selectively acquire adjacent software solutions that can be sold broadly across our account base, as well as to acquire new technologies that we can leverage across our existing software solution portfolio. We completed six, four, and seven acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  Income taxes. The JOBS Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and resulted in a provisional income tax expense primarily due to the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings and deferred tax impacts. We completed the accounting for the effects of the JOBS Act in the year ended December 31, 2018 and recorded a  4,318 increase to income tax expense related to provisional amounts recorded in 2017. In October 2018, we had intercompany sales of certain intangible operating assets between our foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in a non-recurring net tax benefit of  46,369.  Impact of COVID-19. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic related to the rapidly growing outbreak of the disease COVID-19, caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 outbreak and certain preventative or protective actions that governments, businesses, and individuals have taken in respect of COVID-19 have resulted in global business disruptions.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a number of initiatives to ensure the safety of our colleagues and enable them to move to a work from home environment seamlessly and continue working effectively. These initiatives included providing our colleagues with necessary equipment, making certain that all colleagues had means of video and audio communications online, and guaranteeing that our network bandwidth was sufficient. Our business model is such that we had minimal disruption to our ability to deliver our solutions to accounts, and we believe we did not have any significant loss of productivity during this transition. Almost all of our colleagues have been working from home since March 16, 2020, with a minority of our colleagues working in our office environments on a voluntary basis and abiding by appropriate distancing and sanitary regulations for their region. We communicated regularly and provided on-demand learning and support to our colleagues throughout the transition period. Based on a May 2020 internal survey, a majority of our colleagues are confident in the decisions that Bentley leadership is making regarding employee well-being and safety during this pandemic, and a majority of our colleagues believe that Bentleys response to and communication regarding COVID-19 has been timely and helpful.  The impact of the pandemic on our financial performance has been modest; our revenues have continued to grow given the mission critical nature of our solutions. When compared to levels from the same periods in 2019, our accounts usage of our applications was down approximately 3-5  for the months of March and April 2020, showed improvement to be nearly equivalent to past usage during May and June 2020, modestly declined approximately 2-3  for the months of July through November 2020, and improved to reflect usage growth of approximately 2-3  during December 2020 relative to the same period in the prior year. The most recent pattern of decline in usage follows capital projects within sectors, as opposed to the initial 2020 declines which we observed to follow the geographic spread of the pandemic. The modest, yet persisting, decline in usage has had limited impact on our recurring revenues, which are comprised primarily of longer term contracts. To the extent declines in usage have also occurred within our recurring revenue contracts with shorter term resets, as is the case with our E365 contracts, the usage declines have modestly impacted revenues, notably in those accounts also exposed to capital projects in the industrial and resources sectors, and to a lesser extent, commercial and facilities sectors. The growth of our revenues from perpetual licenses and professional services has been impacted as selected accounts have shifted spend to subscription solutions or delayed new projects.  Moreover, we were quick to find ways to support our accounts and users, including the launch of a Bentley Has Your Back campaign to help our accounts take full advantage of their Bentley software. This campaign included producing over 50 self-help documents, 20 webinars, and several messages guiding users on various topics including how Bentleys solutions should be configured when working with limited bandwidth, how to use a SmartTV as a monitor, and how to leverage specific offerings such as ProjectWise to facilitate collaboration in their own businesses in remote working environments. This guidance and assistance was well received by accounts and we believe helped maximize usage during the pandemic.  We have also taken measures to reduce selected operating expenses, including various costs associated with travel and facilities.  Our business benefits from a resilient business model backed by industry tailwinds and a strong financial profile. We believe that significant public and private investment will continue to drive spend for infrastructure globally, which will continue to drive demand for our solutions. Additionally, we do not have any material account concentration; no single account or group of affiliated accounts represented more than 2.5  of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had  122,006 of cash and cash equivalents, and  253,850 was available under our Credit Facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company refinanced its Credit Facility and completed an offering of convertible debt. For further detail, see Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements.  Components of Results of Operations   We manage our business globally within one operating segment, the development and marketing of computer software and related services, which is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker reviews and manages our business.  Revenues   We generate revenues from subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and professional services.  Subscriptions  SELECT subscriptions  We provide annual recurring subscriptions that accounts can elect to add to a new or previously purchased perpetual license. SELECT provides accounts with benefits, including upgrades, comprehensive technical support, pooled licensing benefits, annual portfolio balancing exchange rights, learning benefits, certain Azure-based cloud collaboration services, mobility advantages, and access to other available benefits. SELECT subscriptions revenues are recognized as distinct performance obligations are satisfied.  Enterprise subscriptions  We provide Enterprise subscription offerings that provides our largest accounts with complete and unlimited global access to our comprehensive portfolio of solutions. ELS provides access for a prepaid annual fee. Our E365 subscription, which was introduced during the fourth quarter of 2018, provides unrestricted access to our comprehensive software portfolio, similar to ELS, however is charged based upon daily usage. The daily usage fee also includes a term license component, SELECT maintenance and support, hosting, and Success Plan services, which are designed to achieve business outcomes through more efficient and effective use of our software. The ELS and E365 offerings both contain a distinct term license component. ELS revenue is recognized as the distinct performance obligations are satisfied. E365 revenue is recognized based upon usage incurred by the account.  Term license subscriptions  We provide annual, quarterly, and monthly term licenses for our software products. ATL subscriptions are generally prepaid annually for named user access to specific products. QTL subscriptions allow accounts to pay quarterly in arrears for licenses usage that is beyond their SELECT contracted quantities. MTL subscriptions are identical to QTL subscriptions, except for the term of the license, and the manner in which they are monetized. MTL subscriptions require a CSS, which is described below.  Visas and Passports are quarterly or annual term licenses enabling accounts to access specific project or enterprise information and entitles our users to certain functionality of our ProjectWise and AssetWise systems. Our standard offerings are usage based with monetization through our CSS program. Annual, quarterly, and monthly term licenses revenues are recognized as the distinct performance obligations for each are satisfied. Billings in advance are recorded as Deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. QTL, MTL, Visas and Passports subscriptions are recognized based upon usage incurred by the account.  CSS is a program designed to streamline the procurement, administration, and payment process. The program requires an estimation of annual usage for CSS eligible offerings and a deposit of funds in advance. Actual consumption is monitored and invoiced against the deposit on a calendar quarter basis. CSS balances not utilized for eligible products or services may roll over to future periods or are refundable. Paid and unconsumed CSS balances are recorded in Accruals and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Software and services consumed under CSS are recognized pursuant to the applicable revenue recognition guidance for the respective software or service and classified as subscriptions or services based on their respective nature.  Perpetual licenses  Perpetual licenses may be sold with or without attaching a SELECT subscription. Historically, attachment and retention of the SELECT subscription has been high given the benefits of the SELECT subscription discussed above. Perpetual licenses revenues are recognized upon delivery of the license to the user.  Services  We provide professional services including training, implementation, configuration, customization, and strategic consulting services. We perform projects on both a time and materials and a fixed fee basis. Our recent and preferred contractual structures for delivering professional services include  i  delivery of services in the form of subscription-like, packaged offerings that are annually recurring in nature, and  ii  delivery of our growing portfolio of Success Plans. Success Plans are standard offerings that offer a level of subscription service above the standard technical support offered to all accounts as part of their SELECT or Enterprise agreement. Revenues are recognized as services are performed.  Headcount-related costs  For the year ended December 31, 2020, 80  of our aggregate cost of revenues, research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative costs were represented by what we refer to herein as headcount-related costs. These costs include the salary costs of our colleagues  our employees  and the corresponding incentives, benefits, employment taxes, and travel-related costs. Our headcount-related costs are variable in nature. We actively manage these costs to align to our trending run rate of revenue performance, with the objective of enhancing visibility and predictability of resulting operating profit margins.  Cost of subscriptions, licenses, and services  Cost of subscriptions and licenses. Cost of subscriptions and licenses includes salaries and other related costs, including the depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of capitalized software costs associated with servicing software subscriptions, the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquired software and technology, channel partner compensation for providing sales coverage to subscribers, as well as cloud-related costs incurred for servicing our accounts using cloud deployed hosted solutions and our license administration platform.  Cost of services. Cost of services includes salaries for internal and third-party personnel and related overhead costs, including depreciation of property and equipment, for providing training, implementation, configuration, and customization services to accounts, amortization of capitalized software costs, and related out-of-pocket expenses incurred.  Operating expenses  Research and development. Research and development expenses, which are generally expensed as incurred, primarily consist of personnel and related costs of our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation, and costs of certain third-party contractors, as well as allocated overhead costs. We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external accounts, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.  We capitalize certain development costs related to certain projects under our ACDP  our structured approach to an in-house business incubator function  once technological feasibility is established. Technological feasibility is established when a detailed program design has been completed and documented; we have established that the necessary skills, hardware, and software technology are available to produce the product; and there are no unresolved high-risk development issues. Once the software is ready for its intended use, amortization is recorded over the softwares estimated useful life  generally three years . Total costs capitalized under the ACDP were  7,809,  6,060, and  5,735 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Additionally, total ACDP related amortization recorded in Costs of subscriptions and licenses was  4,699,  3,516, and  2,052 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  Certain costs related to the creation of foreign language translations are capitalized and amortized over the economic life of the software. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, total costs capitalized related to the creation of foreign language translations were  951,  835, and  877, respectively. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, amortization related to the creation of foreign language translations recorded in Costs of subscriptions and licenses in the consolidated statements of operations was  919,  823, and  1,008, respectively.  Selling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation expense for our selling and marketing colleagues, the expense of travel, entertainment, and training for such personnel, online marketing, product marketing and other brand-building activities, such as advertising, trade shows, and expositions, various sales and promotional programs, and costs of computer equipment and facilities used in selling and marketing activities. We anticipate that we will continue to make strategic investments in our global business systems and methods to enhance major account sales activities and to support our worldwide sales and marketing strategies, and the business in general. We capitalize certain incremental costs of obtaining a contract and recognize these expenses over the period of benefit associated with these costs, resulting in a deferral of certain contract costs each period. The contract costs are amortized based on the economic life of the goods and services to which the contract costs relate. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain channel partner sales incentive programs for which the annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.  General and administrative. General and administrative expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for our finance, human resources, and legal colleagues, the expense of travel, entertainment, and training for such personnel, professional fees for legal and accounting services, and costs of computer equipment and facilities used in general and administrative activities. Following the completion of the IPO, we expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations, and professional services. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenues over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.  Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles includes the amortization of acquired non-product related intangible assets, primarily customer relationships, trademarks, and non-compete agreements recorded in connection with completed acquisitions.  Expenses associated with IPO. These expenses included certain non-recurring costs relating to our IPO, consisting of the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the sale of shares by the selling stockholders, professional fees, and other expenses. We completed our IPO on September 25, 2020. These fees were expensed in the period incurred.  Interest expense, net. Interest expense, net primarily represents interest associated with the Credit Facility, amortization of deferred financing costs, and interest income from our investments in money market funds.  Other income  expense , net. Other income  expense , net primarily consists of foreign currency translation results derived primarily from U.S. Dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and intercompany balances held by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. Dollar functional currencies.   Provision  benefit for income taxes.  Provision  benefit for income taxes includes the aggregate consolidated income tax expense for U.S. domestic and foreign income taxes.  Loss from investment accounted for using the equity method, net of tax. Loss from investment accounted for using the equity method includes our proportional share of loss in a joint venture.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase was driven by improvements in our organic performance of  26,757, the impact from acquisitions of  33,463, and the positive foreign currency effects due to a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  4,670. On a constant currency basis, our revenues increased by 8.2  for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.  Subscriptions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, subscriptions revenues increased by  70,973, or 11.7 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven primarily by improvements in our organic performance of  52,012, and to a lesser extent, the impact from acquisitions of  14,841, as well as the positive foreign currency effects due to a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  4,120. On a constant currency basis, our subscriptions revenues increased by 11.0  for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Approximately 50  of our organic performance expansion was driven by ProjectWise and civil design products for the year ended December 31, 2020.  Perpetual licenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, perpetual licenses revenues decreased by  2,311, or 3.9 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was driven by a reduction in our organic performance of  4,427, partially offset by the impact from acquisitions of  1,706, as well as the positive foreign currency effects due to a weaker U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  410. On a constant currency basis, our perpetual licenses revenues decreased by 4.6  for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.  We observed a decrease in organic performance for the year ended December 31, 2020 as certain accounts delayed purchase decisions or shifted spend to subscription solutions due to COVID-19.  Services. For the year ended December 31, 2020, services revenues decreased by  3,772, or 5.5 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization of purchased intangibles increased by 8.0 , or 7.3  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions that closed in 2020.  Expenses associated with initial public offering. For the year ended December 31, 2020, expenses associated with IPO included certain non-recurring costs relating to our IPO, consisting of the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to the sale of shares by the selling stockholders, professional fees, and other expenses. We completed our IPO on September 25, 2020. These fees were expensed in the period incurred.

The foreign exchange gains  losses  derive primarily from U.S. Dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and intercompany balances held by foreign subsidiaries. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, intercompany finance transactions denominated in U.S. Dollars resulted in unrealized foreign exchange gains  losses  of  22,310 and   5,270 , respectively. These U.S. Dollar denominated balances are being translated into their functional currencies at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date and fully eliminate in consolidation. The gains and losses from such translations are included in Other income  expense , net.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, other income  expense , net also includes a gain from the change in fair value of our interest rate swap of  347 and a gain from the change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration of  1,340.   Provision  Benefit for Income Taxes  The income tax provisions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on the effective income tax rates applicable for those periods. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized an aggregate consolidated income tax expense of  38,625 and  23,738, respectively, for U.S. domestic and foreign income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of  8,644 and  2,940, respectively, associated with stock-based compensation. The effective income tax rate of 23.0  for the year ended December 31, 2020 was higher than the effective income tax rate of 18.5  for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to officer compensation limitation provisions resulting from our IPO, which went effective during the third quarter of 2020, and the non-deductibility of expenses associated with our IPO, partially offset by increased discrete windfall tax benefits from stock-based compensation.  Net Income  Year Ended  December 31,  2020 2019  Net income   126,521   103,096  For the year ended December 31, 2020, net income increased by  23,425, or 22.7 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The changes are due to the factors stated above.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income  Year Ended  December 31,  2020 2019  Adjusted EBITDA   266,199   188,129  Adjusted Net Income   192,678   135,049  For the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA increased by  78,070 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

The change in revenues was significantly impacted by the adoption of Topic 606, which impacted the timing, allocation, and presentation of subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and services revenues. The most significant impact from the adoption of Topic 606 relates to timing of revenue recognition for perpetual licenses and the accounting for certain of our subscription arrangements that include term-based software licenses bundled with support. Under Topic 606, both perpetual license and prepaid term-based software license revenues are recognized upfront upon delivery of the software license. Under Topic 605, revenue for perpetual licenses was recognized over a three-year period, while revenue attributable to the term-based software licenses was recognized ratably over the term. Revenue recognition related to support, hosting, usage-based offerings, and services is substantially unchanged, with support and hosting revenue recorded ratably over the contract term, usage-based revenue recognized upon usage or delivery, and services revenue recognized as delivered. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in a net reduction in subscriptions revenues of  5,625, and a net increase in perpetual licenses revenues of  7,174 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our services revenues have not been significantly impacted by the adoption of Topic 606. On an annual basis, we expect our subscriptions revenues recognized under Topic 606 to be comparable to such revenues recognized under Topic 605. This expectation is attributable to the annual, recurring nature of our subscription agreements. However, under Topic 606, the conversion of our existing subscription users to consumption-based offerings with consumption measurement durations of less than one year, such as our E365 subscription offering, as well as the term start date of new annual term license subscriptions, introduces some volatility between periods and impacts period-over-period comparability. For additional information, see the section titled -Key Factors Impacting Comparability and Performance. For additional information on the impact of adoption of Topic 606 on our results, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.  Net of the impact from adopting Topic 606 of  1,805, total revenues increased by  43,139, or 6.2 , for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven primarily by improvements in our organic performance of  53,827, and to a lesser extent, the impact from acquisitions of  7,597, partially offset by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  18,285. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our revenues increased by 8.9  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  Subscriptions. Net of the decrease from adopting Topic 606 of  5,625, subscriptions revenues increased by  56,504, or 10.1 , for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven primarily by improvements in our organic performance of  61,325, and to a lesser extent, the impact from acquisitions of  10,448, partially offset by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  15,269. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our subscriptions revenues increased by 12.9  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  The increase in organic performance was primarily due to expansion within our existing accounts, as reflected by our recurring revenues dollar-based net retention rate of 108 . Approximately 2  of the increase was attributed to new accounts. Approximately 50  of our organic performance expansion was driven by ProjectWise and civil design products.  Perpetual licenses. Net of the increase from adopting Topic 606 of  7,174, perpetual licenses revenues decreased by  8,546, or 14.0 , for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven by a reduction in our organic performance of  2,735, the net negative impact from acquisitions and acquisition integration of  4,069, as well as by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  1,742. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our perpetual licenses revenues decreased by 11.1  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  The negative impact from acquisition integration of  4,498 relates to a 2018 acquisition. In 2018 we recognized perpetual license revenues from this acquisition of  4,061. License revenues were recognized upon delivery. Upon completing acquisition integration and beginning in 2019, such license sales were subject to our SELECT subscription program, including the portfolio balancing performance obligation. As a result, beginning in 2019 we would have recognized such license revenues ratably over a three-year period under Topic 605. In connection with this acquisition, we sold  6,317 of licenses in 2019, of which  823 was ratably recognized in 2019 and the balance of  5,494 was deferred under Topic 605. For comparison purposes, under Topic 606, revenue of  6,317 was recognized upon delivery in 2019.  Services. Net of the increase from adopting Topic 606 of  256, services revenues decreased by  4,819, or 6.6 , for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in our organic performance of  4,763, as well as by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  1,274, partially offset by the impact from acquisitions of  1,218. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our services revenues decreased by 4.8  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  The decrease in organic performance was primarily due to the completion of several larger services projects during 2018 and the partial redeployment of our services colleagues to support Success Plan services of our E365 subscription offering.  Revenues by Geographic Area  Revenues are allocated to individual countries based upon the location of the users. Revenues by geographic area are as follows   Comparison  Impact  Year Ended December 31, from  2019 2018 Adoption Constant  As Reported As Reported of Topic Remaining Currency  Topic 606 Topic 605 Amount   606 Difference      Revenues by geographic area   Americas   356,331   328,749   27,582 8.4      4,603    32,185 9.8   10.8    EMEA 236,602 231,486 5,116 2.2   1,348 3,768 1.6   6.0    APAC 143,721 131,475 12,246 9.3   5,060 7,186 5.5   9.1    Total revenues by geographic area   736,654   691,710   44,944 6.5     1,805   43,139 6.2   8.9    For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues reported under Topic 606 for our Americas, EMEA and APAC geographic areas, as compared to the revenues reported under Topic 605 for the year ended December 31, 2018, increased by  27,582, or 8.4 ,  5,116, or 2.2 , and  12,246, or 9.3 , respectively.  Americas. Net of the decrease from adopting Topic 606 of  4,603, revenues from the Americas increased by  32,185, or 9.8 , for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven primarily by improvements in our organic performance of  30,993 and, to a lesser extent, the impact from acquisitions of  4,527, partially offset by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  3,335. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our revenues from the Americas increased by 10.8  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  The increase in organic performance was primarily due to expansion of our recurring revenues from our existing accounts in the United States and Canada. Approximately 50  of our organic performance expansion was driven by ProjectWise and civil design products.  EMEA. Net of the increase from adopting Topic 606 of  1,348, revenues from EMEA increased by  3,768, or 1.6 , for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven primarily by improvements in our organic performance of  11,665 and, to a lesser extent, the impact from acquisitions of  6,818, partially offset by the negative impact from acquisition integration of  4,498 and by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  10,217. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our revenues from EMEA increased by 6.0  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  The increase in organic performance was primarily due to expansion of our recurring revenues throughout the region. Approximately 50  of our organic performance expansion was driven by ProjectWise and Offshore Structural Analysis products.  The negative impact from acquisition integration relates to a 2018 acquisition. In 2018 we recognized perpetual license revenues from this acquisition of  4,061. License revenues were recognized upon delivery. Upon completing acquisition integration and beginning in 2019, such license sales were subject to our SELECT subscription program, including the portfolio balancing performance obligation. As a result, beginning in 2019 we would have recognized such license revenues ratably over a three-year period under Topic 605. In connection with this acquisition, we sold  6,317 of licenses in 2019, of which  823 was ratably recognized in 2019 and the balance of  5,494 was deferred under Topic 605. For comparison purposes, under Topic 606, revenue of  6,317 was recognized upon delivery in 2019.  APAC. Net of the increase from adopting Topic 606 of  5,060, revenues from APAC increased by  7,186, or 5.5 , for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven primarily by improvements in our organic performance of  11,169 and, to a lesser extent, the impact from acquisitions of  750, partially offset by negative foreign currency effects due to a stronger U.S. Dollar relative to our other functional currencies of  4,733. On a constant currency basis and net of the impact from adopting Topic 606, our revenues from APAC increased by 9.1  for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior period.  The increase in organic performance was primarily due to expansion of our recurring revenues from our existing accounts in Australia and China. Approximately 50  of our organic performance expansion was driven by ProjectWise and civil design products.  Cost of Revenues  Comparison  Impact  Year Ended December 31, from  2019 2018 Adoption Constant  As Reported As Reported of Topic Remaining Currency  Topic 606 Topic 605 Amount   606 Difference      Cost of subscriptions and licenses   71,578   55,113   16,465 29.9     139   16,326 29.6   32.8    Cost of services 72,572 76,211  3,639   4.8    -  3,639   4.8     2.2     Total cost of revenues   144,150   131,324   12,826 9.8     139   12,687 9.7   12.5    For the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of revenues reported under Topic 606 increased by  12,826, or 9.8 , to  144,150 as compared to cost of revenues reported under Topic 605 for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in cost of subscriptions and licenses, partially offset by lower cost of services relative to the prior period. Cost of revenues has not been significantly impacted by the adoption of Topic 606.  Net of the increase from adopting Topic 606 of  139, cost of subscriptions and licenses increased 29.6 , or 32.8  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On a constant currency basis, this increase was primarily due to an increase in hosting costs of approximately  6,600, an increase in headcount-related costs of approximately  6,000, an increase in amortization expense of approximately  1,500 related to certain projects under our ACDP, an increase in reseller costs of approximately  1,900 and an increase in amortization expense of approximately  1,000 for software and technology.  Cost of services decreased by 4.8 , or 2.2  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On a constant currency basis, the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in headcount-related costs of approximately  1,100 as well as a decrease in the recognition of previously capitalized costs related to certain professional services projects of approximately  500.

Research and development expenses increased 4.9 , or 7.2  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On a constant currency basis, the increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount-related costs of approximately  8,800, as well as an increase in facility-related costs of approximately  3,300.  Selling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 3.3 , or 1.0  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily caused by a reduction in sales incentives, which were at an elevated level for the year ended December 31, 2018.  General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 9.2 , or 10.6  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On a constant currency basis, the increase was primarily caused by an increase in headcount-related costs of approximately  8,600, as well as approximately  900 related to incremental accounting costs associated with the IPO.  Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased by 1.5 , or 4.4  in constant currency, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisitions that closed in 2018.  Interest Expense, Net  Year Ended  December 31,  2019 2018  Interest expense    9,731     9,607   Interest income 1,532 842  Total interest expense, net    8,199     8,765   Year Ended  December 31,  2019 2018  Bank credit facility    8,971     8,800   Amortization of deferred financing costs  553   552   Other, net 1,325 587  Total interest expense, net    8,199     8,765   Our net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased from the prior year period primarily due to an offsetting increase in interest income from our investments in money market funds.  Other Income  Expense , Net  Year Ended  December 31,  2019 2018  Foreign exchange loss    5,591     418   Other income, net 34 654  Total other income  expense , net    5,557    236  Other income  expense , net for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 primarily consists of foreign exchange losses of  5,591 and  418, respectively. The foreign exchange losses derive primarily from U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany balances, cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable held by foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. Dollar functional currencies. In October 2018, we had intercompany sales of certain intangible operating assets between our foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in significant U.S. Dollar denominated intercompany liabilities at foreign subsidiaries with a non-U.S. Dollar functional currency  mainly Euro . These U.S. Dollar denominated balances are being translated into their functional currencies at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date and fully eliminate in consolidation. The gains and losses from such translations are included in Other income  expense , net. For the year ended December 31, 2019, such intercompany balances resulted in unrealized foreign exchange losses of  5,270.   Provision  Benefit for Income Taxes  The income tax provisions for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were based on the effective income tax rates applicable for those periods. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized an aggregate consolidated income tax expense  benefit  of  23,738 and   29,250 , respectively, for U.S. domestic and foreign income taxes. The effective income tax rate of 18.5  for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of the timing and mix of U.S. and foreign income. The effective income tax rate of  25.9   for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily impacted by a non-recurring tax benefit of  46,369 resulting from an intercompany sale of certain intangible operating assets. The provision for income tax under Topic 605 would have been  21,762 for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Loss from Investment Accounted for Using the Equity Method, Net of Tax  In September 2019, we and Topcon Positioning Systems, Inc. formed DCW, a joint venture which operates as a digital integrator of software and cloud services for the construction industry. DCWs focus is to transform the construction industry from its legacy document-centric paradigm by simplifying and enabling digital automated workflows and processes, technology integration, and digital twinning services for infrastructure.  We have a 50  ownership in DCW and apply the equity method of accounting for our investment in DCW as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. Under the equity method, we recognized our initial investment at cost and subsequently adjust it by our proportional share of income or losses from the investment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the loss from investment accounted for using the equity method, net of tax, related to the investment was  1,275.  Net Income  Year Ended December 31,  2019 2018  As Reported As Reported As Reported  Topic 606 Topic 605 Topic 605  Net income   103,096   103,426   142,112  For the year ended December 31, 2019, net income under Topic 606 decreased by  39,016, or 27.5    38,686, or 27.2 , under Topic 605 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 under Topic 605. The change is due to the factors stated above.  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income  Year Ended December 31,  2019 2018  As Reported As Reported As Reported  Topic 606 Topic 605 Topic 605  Adjusted EBITDA   188,129   186,598   171,768  Adjusted Net Income   135,049   135,471   132,246  For the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted EBITDA under Topic 606 increased by  16,361  or  14,830 under Topic 605  compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 under Topic 605. These increases were primarily due to an increase in income from operations, net of adjustments discussed in the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial Data. The larger increase under Topic 606 is primarily driven by the upfront recognition of perpetual license revenue under Topic 606 as compared to ratable recognition over a three-year period under Topic 605, partially offset by lower subscription revenue due to ELS to E365 conversions. For additional information, see the section titled -Key Factors Impacting Comparability and Performance.  Under Topic 605, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 25.4  and 24.8  for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Under Topic 606, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue was 25.5  for the year ended December 31, 2019.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, Adjusted Net Income under Topic 606 increased by  2,803  or  3,225 under Topic 605  compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 under Topic 605. These increases were primarily due to an increase in income from operations net of adjustments. The increase in Adjusted Net Income under Topic 606, when compared to Topic 605, was positively impacted by the upfront recognition of perpetual license revenue as compared to ratable recognition over a three-year period under Topic 605. This increase was offset by lower subscription revenue due to ELS to E365 conversions and a slightly higher provision for income taxes under Topic 606 when compared to Topic 605.  Under Topic 605, Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of revenue was 18.4  and 19.1  for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Under Topic 606, Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of revenue was 18.3  for the year ended December 31, 2019.  For additional information, including the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures stated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, see the section titled -Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our primary source of cash is generated from the delivery of subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and services. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of colleague-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities, and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of software assets and businesses.  Our cash and cash equivalent balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 94  and 98 , respectively, of our total cash and cash equivalents were located outside of the United States. Under the JOBS Act, we are subject to U.S. taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations. We intend to continue to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. We expect to meet our U.S. liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows or external borrowings including available liquidity under the Credit Facility described below. We regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure that we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed and to fund our operations and growth investments with cash that has not been permanently reinvested outside the United States.  We believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, together with cash generated from operations and liquidity under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital and capital expenditure requirements through the next twelve months. However, our future capital requirements may be materially different than those currently planned in our budgeting and forecasting activities and depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of spending on research and development, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, currency fluctuations, market acceptance of our products, competitive factors, and overall economic conditions, globally. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders, while the incurrence of debt financing, including convertible debt, would result in debt service obligations. Such debt instruments also could introduce covenants that might restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.  Cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash held in checking accounts and money market funds maintained at various financial institutions. The following table presents our foreign and domestic holdings of cash and cash equivalents   December 31,  2020 2019  Cash and cash equivalents   Held domestically   7,861   2,291  Held by foreign subsidiaries 114,145 118,810  Total cash and cash equivalents   122,006   121,101  The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets.  Bank Credit Facility. On December 19, 2017, we entered into the Credit Facility, which matures on December 18, 2022. Upon entry into the Credit Facility, we obtained a  500,000 senior secured revolving facility and refinanced all indebtedness outstanding under our prior facility.  On September 2, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Facility, which provided the Term Loan of  125,000 with a maturity of December 18, 2022 and included certain other amendments, including the addition of a mandatory prepayment provision requiring us to prepay borrowings under the Credit Facility in an aggregate amount equal to the net proceeds from any underwritten public offering by us, which prepayment shall be applied, first, to the Term Loan and, second, to any borrowings outstanding under the revolving facility under the Credit Facility without reducing the revolving commitments thereof. We used borrowings under the Term Loan and under the revolving facility under the Credit Facility to pay a special dividend of  1.50 per share of our common stock  approximately  389,300 in the aggregate   the Special Dividend  and a regular quarterly dividend of  0.03 per share of our common stock. The Special Dividend was declared by our board of directors on August 28, 2020. In November 2020, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the Follow-On Offering to repay the  125,000 Term Loan. See Notes 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements.  In addition to the revolving line of credit, the Credit Facility also provides up to  50,000 of letters of credit and other incremental borrowings subject to availability, including a  50,000 multi-currency swing-line sub-facility and a  100,000 incremental accordion sub-facility. We had  150 and  546 of letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had  253,850 and  265,704, respectively, available under the Credit Facility.  Under the Credit Facility, we may make either Euro currency or non-Euro currency interest rate elections. Interest on the Euro currency borrowings is at the one-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 100 basis points  bps  to 225 bps as determined by our net leverage ratio. Under the non-Euro currency elections, Credit Facility borrowings bear a base interest rate of the greater of  i  the prime rate,  ii  the overnight bank funding effective rate plus 50 bps, or  iii  LIBOR plus 100 bps, plus a spread ranging from 0 bps to 125 bps as determined by our leverage ratio. In addition, a commitment fee for the unused Credit Facility ranges from 15 bps to 30 bps as determined by our net leverage ratio.  Borrowings under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of our first tier domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our and the guarantors U.S. assets and 65  of the stock of their directly owned foreign subsidiaries. The Credit Facility contains both affirmative and negative covenants, including maximum leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements.  Interest rate risk associated with the Credit Facility is managed through an interest rate swap which we executed on March 31, 2020. The swap has an effective date of April 2, 2020 and a termination date of April 2, 2030. Under the terms of the swap, we fixed our LIBOR borrowing rate at 0.73  on a notional amount of  200,000. The interest rate swap is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes. We account for the swap as either an asset or a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and carry the derivative at fair value. Gains and losses from the change in fair value are recognized in Other income  expense , net, in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a swap related asset at fair value of  347.  The weighted average interest rate under the Credit Facility was 1.92 , 3.47 , and 3.28  for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. There were no accrued interest or fees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Interest expense was  6,878,  8,971, and  8,800 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred  432 of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan. In addition, interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing costs of  553 for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and  552 for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The agreement governing the Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenants defaults, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness in excess of  10,000, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, judgment defaults in excess of  10,000, failure of any security document supporting the Credit Facility to be in full force and effect, and a change of control.  Voluntary prepayments of amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, in whole or in part, are permitted at any time, so long as we give notice as required by the Credit Facility. However, if prepayment is made with respect to a LIBOR-based loan and the prepayment is made on a date other than an interest payment date, we must pay customary breakage costs.  Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019  The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019   Year Ended December 31,  2020 2019  Net Cash Provided By  Used In    Operating activities   258,340   170,773  Investing activities  117,333   53,693   Financing activities  136,511   77,048   Operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities was  258,340 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Compared to the prior year comparative period, net cash from operating activities was higher by  87,567 due to an increase in net income of  23,425, a net increase in non-cash adjustments of  11,254, and an increase in net cash flows from the change in operating assets and liabilities of  52,888. The net increase in non-cash adjustments primarily related to a  3,957 increase in depreciation and amortization, an increase of  15,514 in deferred income taxes, an increase of  24,023 in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase of  29,813 related to foreign currency remeasurement gains. The net increase in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of  52,888 was due to increased cash flows related to the collection of accounts receivable of  33,540, an increase from the change in prepaid and other assets of  12,373, an increase from the change in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities of  5,776, and an increase from the change in income taxes payable of  1,496, partially offset by a decrease from the change in deferred revenues of  297.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was  170,773 due to net income of  103,096 increased by  53,199 of non-cash adjustments and  14,478 from changes in operating assets and liabilities.  Investing activities  Net cash used in investing activities was  117,333 for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to  15,496 related to purchases of property and equipment and investment in capitalized software and  93,032 in acquisition related payments, net of cash acquired.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was  53,693, primarily due to  15,804 related to purchases of property and equipment and investment in capitalized software and  34,054 in acquisition related payments, net of cash acquired.  Financing activities  Net cash used in financing activities was  136,511 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Compared to the prior year comparative period, net cash used in financing activities increased by  59,463, primarily due to an increase in payments for dividends of  397,657, partially offset by an increase in net borrowings of  37,250 under the Credit Facility,  294,429 of proceeds from our Follow-On Offering, net of expenses, and a decrease in the payment of acquisition debt and other consideration of  7,604.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in financing activities was  77,048, primarily due to net payments under the Credit Facility of  25,000, payment of a contingent acquisition liability of  11,029, payments of dividends of  24,989, and net payments for shares acquired of  19,656.  Subsequent Events After December 31, 2020  Bank Credit Facility - On January 25, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which matures on November 15, 2025  the New Credit Facility . Upon entry into the New Credit Facility, we obtained a  850,000 senior secured revolving facility and refinanced all indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility. As of February 28, 2021, the Company had  849,850 available under the Credit Facility.  Convertible Debt - On January 26, 2021, we completed an offering of  690,000 of 0.125  convertible senior notes due 2026. Interest will accrue from January 26, 2021 and will be payable twice a year with the first payment due on July 15, 2021. We used  25,530 of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions and approximately  250,500 to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility and to pay related fees and expenses. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2026 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include funding future acquisitions. We may apply all or a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, software solutions, and technologies that we believe are complementary to our own, although we have no agreements, commitments, or understandings with respect to any specific material acquisition at this time. We have not allocated any specific portion of the net proceeds to any particular purpose and our management will have the discretion to allocate the proceeds as it determines. For further detail, see Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements.  Acquisition - In February 2021, we completed the acquisition of E7. The acquisition is not expected to be material to the our consolidated statements of operations and financial position.  Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments   The following table represents our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020. The information presented in the table below reflects managements estimates of the contractual maturities of our obligations. These maturities may differ from the actual maturities of these obligations.  Payments Due By Period  Within After  Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years  Long-term debt  1     246,000   -   246,000   -   -  Interest on long-term debt  1   20,086 5,890 6,902 2,334 4,960  Operating lease obligations  2   50,552 17,666 22,660 8,243 1,983  Purchase obligations  3   82,810 37,875 44,935 - -  Deferred compensation obligations  4   2,591 169 394 496 1,532  Contingent obligations  5   4,299 2,884 1,415 - -  Non-contingent obligations  6   2,459 685 1,774 - -  Total contractual obligations   408,797   65,169   324,080   11,073   8,475   1 Long-term debt represents the outstanding balance of  246,000 related to the Credit Facility with a weighted average interest rate of 1.92 . Interest on long-term debt includes our interest rate swap which fixed our LIBOR borrowing rate at 0.73  on a notional amount of  200,000. As our debt has variable interest rates, we projected future interest payments based on market interest rates and the balance outstanding as of December 31, 2020.   2 Operating lease obligations include non-cancelable operating lease commitments for our domestic and international office facilities, office equipment, and vehicles.   3 Purchase obligations include the non-cancelable future cash purchase commitment for services related to the provisioning of our hosted software solutions.   4 Deferred compensation obligations relate to the deferred portion of bonus compensation of certain former colleagues.   5 Contingent consideration from acquisitions.   6 Non-contingent consideration from acquisitions.  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates   Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments, and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments, and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.  Revenue recognition  On January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 606, using the modified retrospective method, under which the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 of  125,464   101,489 net of tax  was recorded as a reduction to the opening balance of Accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheet. The impact from adoption was primarily derived from the timing of revenue recognition of perpetual licenses and the accounting for certain of our subscription arrangements that include term-based software licenses bundled with support. Under the prior guidance, revenue for perpetual licenses was recognized over a three-year period, while revenue attributable to the term-based software licenses was recognized ratably over the term. Under Topic 606, both perpetual license and prepaid term-based software license revenue is recognized upfront upon delivery of the software license. The comparative information for the year ended December 31, 2018 has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under Topic 605. See Note 3 in our consolidated financial statements for a qualitative and quantitative discussion of the adoption impact.  Topic 606 establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.  We generate revenues from subscriptions, perpetual licenses, and professional services.  Subscriptions  SELECT subscriptions. We provide prepaid annual recurring subscriptions that accounts can elect to add to a new or previously purchased perpetual license. SELECT provides accounts with benefits, including upgrades, comprehensive technical support, pooled licensing benefits, annual portfolio balancing exchange rights, learning benefits, certain Azure-based cloud collaboration services, mobility advantages, and access to other available benefits. Under Topic 606, SELECT subscription revenues are recognized as distinct performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations within the SELECT offering, outside of the portfolio balancing exchange right, are concurrently delivered and have the same pattern of recognition. These performance obligations are accounted for ratably over the term as a single performance obligation. Under Topic 605, SELECT subscriptions revenue was recognized on a ratable basis, over the subscription term.  Enterprise subscriptions  We provide Enterprise subscription offerings which provide our largest accounts with complete and unlimited global access to our comprehensive portfolio of solutions. ELS provides access for a prepaid annual fee. ELS contains a term license component, SELECT maintenance and support, hosting, and performance consulting days. The SELECT maintenance and support benefits under ELS do not include a portfolio balancing feature. Revenue is allocated to the various performance obligations based on their respective standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to the term license component is recognized upon delivery at the start of the subscription term while revenues for the SELECT maintenance and support and the performance consulting days are recognized as delivered over the subscription term. Billings in advance are recorded as Deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. Under Topic 605, ELS revenue was recognized on a ratable basis, over the subscription term.  E365 subscriptions, which were introduced during the fourth quarter of 2018, provide unrestricted access to our comprehensive software portfolio, similar to ELS, however are charged based upon daily usage. The daily usage fee includes a term license component, SELECT maintenance hosting, and support, hosting, and Success Plan services, which are designed to achieve business outcomes through more efficient and effective use of our software. E365 revenues are recognized based upon usage incurred by the account under both Topics 606 and 605. Usage is defined as distinct user access on a daily basis. The term of E365 subscriptions aligns with calendar quarters and revenue is recognized based on actual usage.  Term license subscriptions  We provide annual, quarterly, and monthly term licenses for our software products. Term license subscriptions contain a term license component and SELECT maintenance and support. Revenue is allocated to the various performance obligations based on their standalone selling price  SSP . ATL are generally prepaid annually for named user access to specific products. QTL subscriptions allow accounts to pay quarterly in arrears for license usage that is beyond their prepaid subscriptions. MTL subscriptions are identical to QTL subscriptions, except for the term of the license, and the manner in which they are monetized. MTL subscriptions require a CSS, which is described below. For ATL, revenue allocated to the term license component is recognized upon delivery at the start of the subscription term while revenue for the SELECT maintenance and support is recognized as delivered over the subscription term. Billings in advance are recorded as Deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets. Under Topic 605, ATL revenues were recognized on a ratable basis, over the subscription term. For usage-based QTL and MTL subscriptions, revenues are recognized based upon usage incurred by the account under both Topics 606 and 605. Usage is defined as peak usage over the respective terms. The terms of QTL and MTL subscriptions align with calendar quarters and calendar months, respectively, and revenue is recognized based on actual usage.  Visas and Passports are quarterly or annual term licenses enabling users to access specific project or enterprise information and entitles our users to certain functionality of our ProjectWise and AssetWise systems. Our standard offerings are usage based with monetization through our CSS program.  CSS is a program designed to streamline the procurement, administration, and payment process. The program requires an estimation of annual usage for CSS eligible offerings and a deposit of funds in advance. Actual consumption is monitored and invoiced against the deposit on a calendar quarter basis. CSS balances not utilized for eligible products or services may roll over to future periods or are refundable. Paid and unconsumed CSS balances are recorded in Accruals and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Software and services consumed under CSS are recognized pursuant to the applicable revenue recognition guidance for the respective software or service and classified as subscriptions or services based on their respective nature.  Perpetual licenses  Perpetual licenses may be sold with or without attaching a SELECT subscription. Historically, attachment and retention of the SELECT subscription has been high given the benefits of the SELECT subscription. Perpetual license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the license to the user under Topic 606. Under Topic 605, we recognized perpetual licenses revenue ratably over a three-year term due to the portfolio balancing feature users obtain through their SELECT subscriptions.  Services  We provide professional services including training, implementation, configuration, customization, and strategic consulting services. We perform projects on both a time and materials and a fixed fee basis. Our recent and preferred contractual structures for delivering professional services include  i  delivery of the services in the form of subscription-like, packaged offerings which are annually recurring in nature, and  ii  delivery of our growing portfolio of Success Plans. Success Plans are standard offerings which offer a level of subscription service above the standard technical support offered to all accounts as part of their SELECT or Enterprise agreement. Revenues are recognized as services are performed under both Topics 606 and 605.  Significant Judgments and Estimates   Revenue recognition. Our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer licenses  perpetual or term-based , maintenance, and services to a user. Judgment is required to determine if the promises are separate performance obligations, and if so, the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. When an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations which are concurrently delivered and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer, we account for those performance obligations as a single performance obligation. For contracts with more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative SSP of each obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  Our SELECT agreement provides users with perpetual licenses a right to exchange software for other eligible perpetual licenses on an annual basis upon renewal. We refer to this option as portfolio balancing and concluded that the portfolio balancing feature represents a material right resulting in the deferral of the associated revenue. Judgment is required to estimate the percentage of users who may elect to portfolio balance and considers inputs such as historical user elections. This feature is available once per term and must be exercised prior to the respective renewal term. We recognize the associated revenue upon election or when the portfolio balancing right expires. This right is included in the initial and subsequent renewal terms and we reestablish the revenue deferral for the material right upon the beginning of the renewal term. Portfolio balancing exchange rights are included in Deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets.  Business combinations. We allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including trademarks, customer relationships, in-process research and development, and acquired software and technology, based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations.  Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to   future expected cash flows from sales, maintenance agreements, and acquired developed technologies;  the acquired companys trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in our product portfolio;  expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable software and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; and  discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows.  These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates, and, if such events occur, we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities.  Goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets arise from acquisitions and principally consist of goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships, and acquired software and technology. Intangibles, other than goodwill, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to ten years.  Goodwill consists of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead, it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce its fair value below its carrying amount. We operate as a single reporting unit.  The initial step in evaluating goodwill for impairment requires us to determine the reporting units fair value and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill, of such reporting unit. As part of the assessment, an entity may first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not  a likelihood of more than 50 percent  that a goodwill impairment exists. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, we consider the factors identified in ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. We also consider whether there are significant differences between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of our assets and liabilities, and the existence of significant unrecognized intangible assets. Based upon our most recent annual impairment assessment completed as of October 1, 2020, it is not more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. There was no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual impairment assessments conducted for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.  Property and equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to 25 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements or the lease term. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for their intended use.  Cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.  Leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Operating lease liabilities, and Long-term operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate, if our leases do not provide an implicit rate, based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on our estimated credit rating, the term of the lease, economic environment where the asset resides, and full collateralization. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and are reduced by any lease incentives. Options to extend or terminate the lease are considered in determining the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our operating leases are primarily for office space, automobiles, and office equipment. Finance leases are included in Property and equipment, net, Accruals and other current liabilities, and Other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.  Allowance for doubtful accounts. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for expected losses during the accounts receivable collection process. The allowance for doubtful accounts is presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and reduces the accounts receivable balance to the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts and installment receivables. The development of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an expected loss model which considers historical write-off and recovery experience, aging trends affecting specific accounts, and general operational factors affecting all accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.  We consider current economic trends and take into account reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. If circumstances relating to specific customers change or unanticipated changes occur in the general business environment, our estimate of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted.  Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. On March 31, 2020, we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of  200,000 and a ten-year term to reduce the interest rate risk associated with our Credit Facility. The interest rate swap is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes. We account for the swap as either an asset or a liability on the consolidated balance sheet and carry the derivative at fair value. Gains and losses from the change in fair value are recognized in Other income  expense , net and payments related to the swap are recognized in Interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The bank counterparty to the derivative potentially exposes us to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance. To mitigate that risk, we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process. We monitor counterparty risk on at least a quarterly basis and adjust our exposure as necessary. We do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes.  Income taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards, credit carryforwards, and temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the items are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of the enactment date.  We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe the assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded that would increase the provision for income taxes.  On December 22, 2017, the JOBS Act was enacted. This act, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal income tax rate to 21  from 35  in 2018, institutes a dividends received deduction for foreign earnings with a related tax for the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings, and creates a new U.S. minimum tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We completed our accounting for the effects of this legislation in 2018 and have included those effects in  Provision  benefit for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.  We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors, including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments. Any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. It is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax expense based on taxable income by jurisdiction. There are many transactions and calculations about which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. As a result, our calculations involve estimates by management. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue-sharing, cost-reimbursement, and transfer pricing arrangements among related entities, and the differing tax treatment of revenue and cost items across various jurisdictions. If we were compelled to revise or to account differently for our arrangements, that revision could affect our tax liability. While we believe the positions we have taken are appropriate, we record reserves for taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that we believe could be challenged by taxing authorities. We record a benefit on a tax position when we determine that it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained, we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized when it is effectively settled. We review the tax reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes. We follow the applicable guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition with respect to uncertain tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes within the  Provision  benefit for income taxes line in the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.  Stock-based compensation. We record all stock-based compensation as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For all other stock-based arrangements, the stock-based compensation expense is based on the share price at the grant date.  The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, expected volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and expected term. The expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by using the average historic price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available. The expected dividend yield is calculated by dividing our annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by our common stock price  as described below  on the grant date. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at grant date. The expected term is based on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the award.  Fair value of common stock. We have historically been a privately held company with no active public market of our common stock. We were required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards. The fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards was determined by our board of directors, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations. We believe that our board of directors has the relevant experience and expertise to determine the fair value of our common stock.  Prior to the IPO, and given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants practice guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including   contemporaneous independent valuations performed by an unrelated third-party valuation specialist;  the nature of our business and its history;  our operating and financial performance and forecast;  present value of estimated future cash flows;  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering, listing, or sale of our Company, given prevailing market condition and the nature and history of our business;  any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock;  the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; and  the U.S. and global capital market conditions.  In valuing our common stock, our board of directors determined the equity value of our business generally using the income approach and the market comparable approach valuation methods.  The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate such as cash earnings, cost savings, tax deductions, and proceeds from disposition. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate derived from an analysis of the cost of capital of comparable publicly traded companies in our industry or similar lines of business as of each valuation date and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows.  The market comparable approach estimates value based on a comparison of the Company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. To determine our peer group of companies, we considered public enterprises with similar operations and selected those that are similar to our size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and applied to our results of operations to estimate the value of the Company.  Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future cash flows, cost savings and expenses, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impacts our valuations as of each valuation date.  Emerging Growth Company   Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7 a  2  B  of the Securities Act, as amended by Section 102 b  1  of the JOBS Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided in Section 7 a  2  B  for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we  i  are no longer an emerging growth company or  ii  affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in Section 7 a  2  B . As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC regulations.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements   For information regarding recent accounting guidance and the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1. Business  Overview   RealNetworks invented the streaming media category in 1995 and continues to build on its foundation of digital media expertise and innovation, creating a new generation of products and services to enhance and secure our daily lives. In recent years, we have increasingly focused on developing artificial intelligence  AI -based products and services such as our Secure Accurate Facial Recognition  SAFR  computer vision platform and our Kontxt natural language processing-based message classification and analysis product. We provide our software and services to consumers, mobile carriers, device manufacturers, system integrators, and other businesses.  Consumers use our digital media products and services to store, organize, play, manage and enjoy their digital media content, either directly from us or through our distribution partners. For 25 years, RealNetworks has advanced the renowned RealPlayer, which has provided millions of people worldwide a powerful way to download, store, organize, and experience the rapidly expanding universe of digital media content, regardless of format. Our SAFR computer vision platform, a key investment initiative for us, enables new applications for security, convenience, and analytics, and is optimized for live video. Our consumer products feature GameHouse Original Stories, a unique IP portfolio of free-to-play mobile games. Our consumer products also include ringback tones, which we license to mobile operators, and our video compression and enhancement technology, which we primarily license to OEMs, including manufacturers of mobile devices, smart TVs, and set-top boxes. Our product line also includes Kontxt, our AI-based platform for categorizing Application to Person  A2P  messages to help messaging aggregators and mobile carriers provide a better customer experience, strengthen customer loyalty, and drive new revenue through text message management, classification and anti-spam.  The monetization, distribution, and licensing of our technology products and services are heavily dependent on contracts with third parties, such as mobile carriers, system integrators, and device manufacturers.  We were incorporated in 1994 in the State of Washington. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol  RNWK.   In this Annual Report on Form 10-K   10-K   for the year ended December 31, 2020, RealNetworks, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as  RealNetworks,  the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our.   RealPlayer,   RMHD,   RealMedia,   GameHouse,   Kontxt,   SAFR  and other trademarks of ours appearing in this report are our property.  Segments  We report revenue and operating income  loss  in three segments   1  Consumer Media,  2  Mobile Services, and  3  Games. RealNetworks allocates to its Consumer Media, Mobile Services, and Games segments certain corporate expenses which are directly attributable to supporting these businesses, including but not limited to a portion of finance, IT, legal, human resources and headquarters facilities. Remaining expenses, which are not directly attributable to supporting these businesses, are reported as corporate items. These corporate items also can include restructuring charges and stock compensation expense.  As described in Note 4. Acquisitions and Dispositions, RealNetworks acquired an additional 42  interest in Rhapsody International, Inc.  doing business as Napster  on January 18, 2019, which brought our ownership of Napster's outstanding stock to 84 , thus giving us a majority voting interest. For fiscal periods following the closing of the acquisition, we consolidated Napster's financial results into our financial statements, where Napster was reported as a separate segment. In August 2020, we entered into a Support Agreement in connection with the execution by Napster of a definitive agreement pursuant to which Napster would become a wholly owned subsidiary of MelodyVR Group PLC. The transaction closed on December 30, 2020, resulting in our full disposition of our Napster stake. Effective on the execution of the Napster MelodyVR merger agreement on August 25, 2020, Napster was treated as discontinued operations for accounting and disclosure purposes. As such, Napster's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2019 have been recast to conform to this presentation.  Consumer Media  In our Consumer Media segment, revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of our portfolio of video compression and enhancement technology, also known as codec technology. Codecs are an encoding and decoding technology designed to reduce the amount of bits required to stream or store media content, and modern codecs achieve significant savings in streaming bandwidth and storage costs. Our main codec products are RealMedia High Definition, which we refer to as RealMedia HD or RMHD, and RealMedia Variable Bitrate, or RMVB. Our codec technologies business is primarily focused on the Chinese market, where RMVB remains a prevalent, though declining format.  We continue to develop and innovate our video compression and enhancement technology to meet or exceed user demands for increasing compression efficiency and visual quality. We license our codec technology to a variety of electronic equipment, microchip, and integrated circuit manufacturers who embed our codec in their products, including mobile devices,  laptops, smart TVs and other devices. To ensure a robust ecosystem for our codec technologies, we also promote the use of our codec technology to producers of media content and users of RealPlayer, thus encouraging the widespread adoption by device manufacturers.  We also generate revenue through online sales to consumers of our PC-based RealPlayer subscription products, including our SuperPass service, which provides consumers with access to digital entertainment content for a monthly fee. The RealPlayer media player, our enduring yet continually evolving software product, includes features and services that enable consumers to discover, play, download, manage and edit digital video, stream audio and video, download and save photos and videos from the web, transfer and share content on social networks, and edit their own photo and video content. As part of our RealPlayer download process, we also offer distribution of third-party software products to consumers, which generates additional revenue.  Mobile Services  Mobile Services consists of the various digital media services we provide to mobile and online service providers as software as a service  SaaS  offerings. In recent years, we have increasingly focused on AI-based products and services such as SAFR and Kontxt.  Included in our SaaS offerings are our messaging products, which include our Metcalfe intercarrier messaging service; Kontxt, our AI-based text message management, anti-spam, and classification product; and our ringback tone service. We provide these services to a large number of mobile carriers around the world, although a significant portion of our revenue for this segment results from contracts with a few mobile carriers and one service partner. We also offer business intelligence, subscriber management and billing for the carriers who make our offerings available to their customers. Also included in this segment is our computer vision platform, SAFR  Secure Accurate Facial Recognition  and our RealTimes platform.  Our Metcalfe intercarrier messaging platform enables operators to send and receive SMS messages worldwide between networks and service providers, regardless of network technology, typically processing billions of SMS messages per day between users on hundreds of different networks. A portion of the revenue we earn from our intercarrier messaging service is based on a revenue-sharing arrangement with one service partner. Our next-generation AI-based mobile messaging platform, Kontxt, evaluates message streams sent from an application to a person  A2P  and classifies those messages into various categories allowing network operators and other service providers to create policies for prioritization and delivery of messages and blocking spam and fraudulent messages, resulting in more efficient text message delivery.  Our ringback tone services enable callers to hear subscriber-selected music or messages instead of the traditional electronic ringing sound while waiting for the person they have called to answer. We primarily offer ringback tone services via mobile carriers, where, in return for providing, operating and managing the ringback tone service for the carrier customers, we generally enter into revenue-sharing arrangements with the carriers based on monthly subscription fees, content download fees or a combination of such fees paid by subscribers.  Our photo and video sharing platform, RealTimes, is offered to wireless carriers for integration in their hosted cloud solutions. Within our Mobile Services group, we focus on leveraging current and prospective wireless carrier relationships to increase integration of the RealTimes platform.  Our computer vision platform, SAFR, detects faces and other types of objects by leveraging AI-based machine learning. We continue to invest in and build industry partnerships for SAFR, typically licensing it to technology partners and system integrators through third-party resellers and directly to end customers. Our SAFR platform is a key investment initiative for us.  Games  Our Games segment is focused on the development, publishing, and distribution of casual games, which are offered via mobile devices, digital downloads, and subscription play. Casual games typically have simple graphics, rules and controls, are quick to learn, and often include time-management, board, card, puzzle, word and hidden-object games. Our primary focus is our free-to-play mobile games, most notably our Delicious Bed and Breakfast and our Delicious World games. These free-to-play games generate revenue from player purchases of in-game goods and from advertising displayed to consumers during play.  Our mobile games are digitally distributed through third-party application storefronts, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play, and are principally offered in North America, Europe and Latin America. Historically, we have also offered premium games that we typically introduce to consumers upon release on a free-trial basis. After reaching a certain level of game play, consumers then have the option of purchasing the full game. Although games previously offered for individual purchase will continue to be available, during 2019, we began to shift our strategy to free-to-play games and away from premium mobile games.  PC consumers can access and play both our Original Stories and hundreds of third-party games through individual purchases or a subscription service offered through our GameHouse and Zylom websites, and through websites owned or  managed by third parties. Consistent with our mobile offerings, we have historically introduced new games by offering a free trial before purchase on an individual-game basis or as part of one of our subscription services.  See Note 18. Segment Information, in this 10-K for additional details on our segments and geographic concentrations.  Customers  Our customers include consumers and businesses located throughout the world. Sales to customers outside the U.S., primarily in Europe and Asia, were 36  and 40  of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 18. Segment Information, for details on geographic concentrations, and see Note 6. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable and Sales Returns, for details on customer revenue concentrations.  Research and Development  We devote a substantial portion of our resources to developing new products, enhancing existing products, expanding and improving our fundamental technology, and strengthening our technological expertise in all our businesses.  Sales, Marketing and Distribution  Our marketing programs are aimed at increasing brand awareness of our products and services and stimulating demand. We use a variety of methods to market our products and services, including paid search advertising, affiliate marketing programs, electronic and other online media, and email offers to qualified potential and existing customers, and providing product specific information through our websites. We also cross-market products and services offered by some of our businesses through the RealPlayer and Games marketing and distribution channels. We have subsidiaries and offices in several countries that market and sell our products outside the U.S.  Our products and services are marketed through direct and indirect channels. We use public relations, trade shows, events and speaking opportunities to market our products and services. We also use a variety of online channels, including social media, to promote and sell our products and services directly.  In our Consumer Media business, we market and sell our various RealPlayer services directly through our own websites such as Real.com, as well as indirectly through third party distribution partners. We also employ a sales team in China which works with distribution partners on marketing our codec technologies.  Our Mobile Services sales, marketing and business development teams works closely with many of our enterprise, infrastructure, wireless, broadband, media and governmental customers to identify new business opportunities for our entertainment applications, services and systems. Through ongoing communications with the product and marketing divisions of our customers, we tailor our SaaS offerings to their strategic needs and the needs of their subscribers.  In our Games business, we market directly from our GameHouse and Zylom websites and through third-party distribution channels, such as application storefronts, search engines, online portals, and content publishers.  Customer Support  Customer support is integral to the provision of nearly all of our consumer products and services. Consumers who purchase and use our consumer software products and services can get assistance primarily via the Internet or email, depending on the product or service. For some of our consumer products, we contract with third-party outsource support vendors to provide the primary staffing for our first-tier customer support globally. We also provide various support service options for our business customers and for software developers using our software products and associated services. Support service options include online support services and on-site support personnel covering technical and business-related support topics.  Competition  The market for software and services for digital media delivery over the Internet and wireless networks is intensely competitive. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition or brand awareness, more employees or significantly greater resources than we do.  In our Consumer Media segment, our codec technology faces competition from other next-generation video codecs, and many of our competitors have come together in patent pools to market and license a shared codec solution that competes with our own codecs. This coalition of multiple companies, which include some of the largest global technology companies, benefits from a significant inherent market penetration and, thus, a substantial competitive advantage over us. In addition, our RealPlayer media player continues to face competition from alternative streaming media playback applications that have obtained very broad market penetration.  In our Mobile Services segment, our SaaS business competes with a large and diverse number of domestic and international companies, and each of our SaaS offerings tends to face competitors specific to that product or service. Our SaaS  business continues to experience significant competitive pricing pressure from carriers and the proliferation of smartphone applications and services, some of which do not depend on our carrier customers for distribution to consumers. Many of our SaaS services require a high degree of integration with carrier or service provider networks and thus require a high degree of operational expertise. Our ability to enhance services with new features as the digital entertainment market evolves is critical to our competitive position, as is our knowledge of the consumer environment to which these services are targeted. Also within our Mobile Services segment, our computer vision SAFR platform competes with a wide variety of companies, including small startups and well established, heavily resourced global companies. These competitors continue to develop technologies and launch products in the artificial intelligence and facial recognition markets.  Our Games business competes with a variety of distributors and publishers of casual games for PC and mobile platforms. Our in-house game development studios compete with other developers and publishers of mobile games based on our ability to create high quality games that resonate with consumers, and our ability to secure broad distribution.  Intellectual Property  We maintain patents in the U.S. and other jurisdictions relating to various aspects of our technology. We regularly analyze our patent portfolio and prepare additional patent applications on current and anticipated features of our technology, or sell or abandon patents or applications that are no longer relevant or valuable to our operations.  In addition to our patent portfolio, we have assembled, over time, an international portfolio of trademarks and service marks that covers certain of our products and services. We also have applications pending for additional trademarks and service marks in jurisdictions around the world, and have several unregistered trademarks. Many of our marks begin with the word Real  such as RealPlayer . We are aware of other companies that use Real in their marks alone or in combination with other words, and we do not expect to be able to prevent all third-party uses of the word Real for all goods and services.  Our ability to compete across our businesses partly depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of the technology that we both develop and license from third parties. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. These efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology, or may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those we develop.  Human Capital  Recognizing that our employees are the companys most meaningful asset, RealNetworks is committed to employing great people, treating each other with respect, and strictly adhering to the highest ethical and legal principles in its business activities. Each of our business units - Mobile Services, Consumer Media, and Games - have unique brands and products tied together by a workforce that is focused on excellence and on providing industry-leading technologies, applications, and products. This structure strongly informs our corporate culture  We strive to run a lean, agile organization that prioritizes innovation in all facets of our work.  Guiding Management Principles  Part of the fabric of the organization and key to the operation of a performance-based environment are our management principles including commitment to innovation, delivering results, raising the bar in all facets of our work, being inclusive and respectful, being great teammates for each other, and embracing the journey by working hard and celebrating our successes. We consider our workforce a significant competitive advantage and actively seek opportunities to reinforce behaviors that exemplify our management principles. We celebrate employees whose work and actions reflect and embody our management principles with company-wide acknowledgment and awards.  Respectful and Safe Workplace  We want RealNetworks to be a workplace that is open, respectful and safe. RealNetworks encourages and expects the individual actions of its employees at all levels to be consistent with our commitment to a respectful workplace including annual reconfirmation of individual employees adherence to our Global Code of Conduct and Ethics. RealNetworks has been and will continue to be fully committed to providing a work environment free from unlawful discrimination or harassment. Our global policies include prohibition of harassment, threatened or actual workplace violence, or any conduct that undermines an employees integrity or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment even if it does not rise to the level of illegal harassment under the law.  RealNetworks is committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for all employees in compliance with occupational health, safety, and environmental laws. To accomplish this, RealNetworks and its employees adhere to work practices that will prevent accidents, injuries, and illnesses. We consider safety and health issues to be the responsibility of every employee of RealNetworks and we strive to maintain a preventative and cooperative attitude relating to safety issues.  We have had a heightened focus on the safety of our employees and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. In early March 2020, we quickly pivoted to a predominantly remote workforce and restricted employee travel. We have since followed guidance from local health experts to ensure our staff across the globe remain safe. We helped our employees with home office set up and added new system applications to foster virtual collaboration. We have also implemented mitigation practices in all offices to ensure employees are safe when on-site. We will continue to prioritize the well-being of our employees as the pandemic continues.  Compensation and Benefits  We operate in a highly competitive, global, and technologically challenging environment. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to market competitive salaries, we offer additional compensation in the forms of bonuses and stock, which will vary based on job level and location.  Our U.S. benefit programs include a 401 k  plan with employer matching, medical, dental and vision insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, group and voluntary life and disability insurance, business travel and accident coverage, subsidized transit programs, paid time off, paid family leave including bonding time for new parents, financial literacy programs, and employee assistance programs. Our benefit programs in our international locations are tailored to local practices and compliant with local labor laws.  Talent Acquisition and Retention  RealNetworks strives to attract and retain a highly skilled, highly talented, and diverse work force. We recognize that we operate in a highly competitive, globally diverse marketplace when it comes to finding top talent. As a result, talent acquisition and the retention of employees continue to be a priority initiative for RealNetworks, and the Company complies with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which RealNetworks operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.  In 2020, we implemented an Affirmative Action Plan, or AAP, as required by our new U.S. government contractor status. As part of our AAP, we will conduct annual internal reporting and auditing to ensure we are providing equal employment and pay opportunities for all applicants and existing employees. Equally important, we hope that this regular focus on the diversity of our U.S. workforce will make for a more dynamic culture and inclusive workplace.  RealNetworks maintains a global, ongoing performance review program, and encourages mentoring, stretch assignments, and other opportunities for internal career and occupational growth. Our median employee tenure is just over 5 years. We have a long-demonstrated history of employee advancement and promotion from within the organization. We also provide a variety of tools and methods for employees to provide feedback to managers and company leadership including global and local town hall forums, employee surveys, performance review discussions, and anonymous reporting tools.  Corporate Giving  RealNetworks has a strong history of giving back to the community. In 2000, the Company created the RealNetworks Foundation, which in recent years has generally made two annual grants to multiple charities, totaling about  1 million in annual charitable grants. The Foundation also makes ad hoc, emergency grants when deemed needed to support an urgent issue in the community. In 2020, our Foundation donated  500,000 to charities supporting racial justice and  500,000 to charities supporting COVID-19 relief. In addition, the Foundation's matching program supports the dollars and time that RealNetworks employees devote to eligible 501 c  3  nonprofits.  RealNetworks also regularly supports participation by employees in activities of service to our local communities, including Day of Caring, local food drives and holiday toy and gift donations.  Employees  At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 325 employees, of which 101 were based in the Americas, 59 were based in Asia, and 165 were based in Europe. The number of our employees represented by unions is not significant.  Available Information  Our corporate Internet address is www.realnetworks.com. We make available free of charge on www.investor.realnetworks.com our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC . However, the information found on our corporate website is not part of this or any other report."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. Risk Factors  You should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results, and the trading price of our common stock, could be materially harmed.  Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic  Our operating plans and financial condition have been adversely affected by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to experience continued adverse effects in future periods in connection with the ongoing public health and safety, governmental, and economic implications.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. As the virus spread throughout 2020, across the U.S. and the world, authorities implemented numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations, and shutdowns. In addition to the pandemic's widespread impact on public health and global society, reactions to the pandemic as well as measures taken to contain the virus initially caused significant turmoil to the global economy and financial markets. To address the public health and safety concerns, we have taken steps to support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, which include working remotely and learning to operate our businesses in a fundamentally different way.  To date, we have had to change certain strategy and product plans in order to address implications of the pandemic to our businesses, in particular, to our growth initiatives. Although forced to furlough some employees in the early days of the pandemic, we were able to bring those employees back to work during the second quarter of 2020. We also reduced expenditures during the year in an effort to efficiently manage our businesses in the restricted and uncertain climate, although we continue to face risk related to fixed facilities costs given the uncertain post-pandemic future of the use of physical office space. In addition, the initial turmoil in financial markets contributed to significant downward pressure on our stock price early in the pandemic. We cannot provide assurance that the actions we have taken will be sufficient, or that conditions will improve as the pandemic, and reactions thereto, continue to evolve.  The COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant economic instability and financial market turmoil has added complexity, uncertainty and risk to nearly all aspects of our business. We are unable to fully predict the near-term and long-term impacts that the pandemic will have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows for fiscal 2021 or beyond.  Risks Related to our Strategy  Our growth initiatives could take longer than planned, be unsuccessful, or deplete our cash resources, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the performance of our businesses and financial results, and could cause us to pursue additional debt or other funding sources.  In recent years, we have developed new products and technologies, and funded initiatives, intended to create growth in our businesses, while simultaneously taking steps to reduce costs and increase profitability. These growth initiatives, several of which have been unsuccessful over recent years, have impacted all segments of our organization, requiring us to allocate limited resources among our diverse business units. Our financial sustainability is largely dependent on the success of our growth initiatives, and there are many risks to that success, some of which are internal to our company, including our ability to develop and monetize our products and services, and some of which are externally driven and outside of our control, such as the potential impact of macroeconomic pressures and global pandemics. In particular, we expect that progress with our growth initiatives will be negatively impacted by various reactions to the global outbreak of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, community lockdowns, tightening of corporate budgets, reduction in consumer confidence, and instability in financial markets. We cannot predict the duration or severity of these reactions or impacts to our business and, if prolonged, our cash reserves may prove insufficient, requiring us to pursue additional debt or other funding sources.  Given the ambitious and significant nature of our growth initiatives, there is substantial risk that we may be unsuccessful in implementing our plans in a timely manner, our cash reserves may be depleted or insufficient to fully implement our plans, our growth initiatives may not gain adequate momentum, or the combination of our growth initiatives and cost reductions may not prove to be profitable. Moreover, our acceptance of outside funding for any of our growth businesses, such as Scener's 2020 fundraising, exposes us to new risks and potential liabilities, including possible payment obligations and securities liability. Our business would suffer, and our operational results and financial outlook would be negatively impacted to a significant degree in the event that any of our growth initiatives fail.  In August 2019, RealNetworks and Napster entered into a loan agreement with a third-party financial institution. Following the December 2020 sale of Napster to MelodyVR, the loan agreement was amended to remove Napster as a co-borrower and, among other modifications, to reduce the amount available under the revolving line of credit to a maximum of  6.5 million. The loan agreement, as amended, matures August 1, 2022 and contains customary covenants, including financial covenants, minimum EBITDA levels, and maintaining an unrestricted cash balance of  1.5 million. We have not had a debt facility in our recent past, therefore the entry into this facility has introduced new risks to the company, including the risk that constraints around covenants may lead to less flexibility in operational decision making, the risk of default and various implications thereof, and the potential increase in liabilities on our balance sheet in the event that we draw down the line of credit.  In April 2020, following an assessment of eligibility and upon approval by our Board of Directors, RealNetworks issued a promissory note in the principal amount of  2.9 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, of the CARES Act. In May 2020, Napster, then-majority owned by RealNetworks though it maintained distinct legal status and control, issued its own promissory note in the principal amount of  1.7 million pursuant to the PPP. On April 23, 2020, the Small Business Administration issued new guidance that introduced some uncertainty as to whether a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets would qualify for participation in the PPP. Subsequently, on April 28, 2020 the Secretary of the Treasury and Small Business Administration announced that the government would review all PPP loans of more than  2 million for which the borrower applied for forgiveness. While we believe that RealNetworks and Napster fully qualified for the loans, should we be audited or reviewed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as a result of filing an application for forgiveness or otherwise, such audit or review could result in the diversion of managements time and attention and legal and reputational costs. RealNetworks applied for forgiveness of its PPP loan in January 2021; Napster applied for forgiveness of its PPP loan in December 2020. If an audit were to be conducted and an adverse finding received, all or a portion of the PPP loan could be required to be returned, which would reduce our liquidity and potentially result in fines and penalties.  The inability to obtain additional debt, whether through draws on our current line of credit or through a new debt facility, or the raising of funds through other means, could negatively impact our liquidity and ability to invest in our growth initiatives, or cause us to consider funding that would impact our governance structure. The occurrence of these or any of the risks described above would impair our financial results and stock price.  We need to successfully monetize our new products and services in order to sustain and grow our businesses, and manage our cash resources.  In order to sustain our current level of business and to implement our growth initiatives, we must successfully monetize our new products and services, including through existing and new relationships with distribution partners, establishing new sales channels, and managing new supply chains. Our digital media products and services must be attractive and useful to distribution partners and end users. The successful acceptance and monetization of these products and services, therefore, is subject to unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including end-user preferences, competing products and services, the rapid pace of change in the market, the effectiveness of our distribution channels, and significant global crises. Any failure by us to timely and accurately anticipate consumers changing needs and preferences, emerging technological trends and data privacy norms, or changes in the competitive or regulatory landscape for our products and services could result in a failure to monetize our new products or the loss of market opportunities, both of which we have experienced at various times in our past.  Moreover, in order to grow our new businesses, we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether the products and services that we are developing or have introduced will meet the demands of the relevant market. As we have experienced, we may not realize a sufficient return, or may experience losses, on these investments, thereby further straining our limited cash resources and negatively affecting our ability to pursue other needed growth or strategic opportunities.  Sustaining and growing our businesses, and managing our cash resources, are subject to these risks inherent in developing, distributing and monetizing our new products and services. Our failure to manage these risks could further impair our operations and financial results to a material degree, and could cause an unsustainable depletion of our cash resources.  Furthermore, our products and services have been in the past and may be in the future subject to legal challenge. Responding to any such claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop distributing or selling, or to redesign our products or services, or to pay damages, any of which could constrain our growth plans and cash resources.  Our businesses, including in connection with our growth initiatives, face substantial competitive challenges that may impair our success, thus negatively impacting our future growth.  Our digital media products and services, including legacy and products services central to our growth initiatives, face a wide variety of competitors, many of which have longer operating histories, greater name or brand recognition, deeper and more expansive market penetration, more employees, and significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, current and potential competitors may include relatively new businesses that develop or use innovative technologies, products or features that could disrupt the market for technologies, products or features that we currently develop and market or seek to develop and market. In attempting to compete with any or all of these competitors, we may experience, as we have in the past, some or all of the following consequences, any of which would adversely affect our operating results and the trading price of our stock   reduced prices or margins;  loss of current and potential customers, or partners and potential partners who distribute our products and services or who provide content that we distribute to our customers;  changes to our products, services, technologies, licenses or business practices or strategies;  lengthened sales cycles;  inability to meet demands for more rapid sales or development cycles;  industry-wide changes in content distribution to customers or in trends in consumer consumption of digital media products and services;  pressure to prematurely release products or product enhancements; or  degradation in our stature or reputation in the market.  Our Consumer Media technologies for media playback and production  RealPlayer, RealMedia VB and RealMedia HD  compete with alternative media playback technologies and audio and video content formats that have obtained broad market penetration. RealMedia VB and RealMedia HD are codecs, technology that enables compression and decompression of the media content in a  usually proprietary  format. We license our codec technology primarily to computer, smartphone and other mobile device manufacturers, and also to other partners that can support our efforts to build a strong ecosystem, like content providers and integrated circuit developers. To compete effectively, codec technologies must appeal to, and be adopted for use by, a wide range of parties  producers and providers of media content, consumers of media content, and device manufacturers who pre-load codec technologies onto their devices. Our ability to sustain or grow this business, which has recently experienced downward pressure, is dependent on the successful promotion and adoption of our codec technologies to a wide and diverse target market, which is a complex and highly uncertain undertaking. If we are unable to compete successfully, our Consumer Media business could decline as it has in the recent past or on a more accelerated basis.  The market for our Mobile Services business is highly competitive and continues to rapidly evolve. Our SaaS services face competition from a proliferation of applications and services, many of which carriers can deploy or offer to their subscribers, or which consumers can acquire independently of their carrier. We expect pricing pressure in this business to continue to materially impact our operating results in this business. Our Mobile Services growth initiatives compete with a wide variety of companies, as small startups and well established, heavily resourced global companies race to develop AI-based technologies and launch products in the computer vision market. The success of these initiatives is highly dependent on our ability to differentiate our product offering within this highly competitive environment.  The branded services in our Games business compete with other developers, aggregators and distributors of mobile, online, and downloadable games. Our competitors vary in size and capabilities, some of which have high volume distribution channels and greater financial resources than we do; while others may be smaller and more able to quickly or efficiently adjust to market conditions. We also face significant price competition in the casual games market, as our competitors increasingly focus on free-to-play games or reduce prices more aggressively. We expect competition to continue to intensify in this market. Our games development studios compete primarily with other developers of mobile, online, and downloadable games, and must continue to develop popular and high-quality game titles. Our Games business must also continue to execute on opportunities to expand the play of our games on a variety of non-PC platforms, including mobile, in order to maintain our competitive position and to grow the business. Moreover, continued growth in our Games business is in part dependent on the availability of funds to invest in marketing, which availability cannot be assured.  Risks Related to our Operations  The distribution and license of our technology products and services are governed by contracts with third parties, the terms of which subject us to significant risks that could negatively impact our revenue, expenses and assumption of liability related to such contracts.  In our Consumer Media and Mobile Services segments, we distribute and license most of our technology products and services pursuant to contracts with third parties, such as mobile carriers and their partners, online service providers, and OEMs and device manufacturers, many of whom may have stronger negotiating leverage due to their size and reach. These contracts govern the calculation of revenue generated and expenses incurred, how we recognize revenue and expenses in our financial statements, and the allocation of risk and liabilities arising from the product or service or distribution thereof. Terms impacting revenue, over which we may have limited if any control, may involve revenue sharing arrangements, end user pricing, usage levels, and exclusivity, all of which significantly affect the level of revenue that we may realize from the relationship.  Moreover, contract terms around marketing and promotion of our products and other expense allocation could result in us bearing higher expenses or achieving weaker performance than we had anticipated from the relationship.  In addition, although our contracts with third parties are typically for a fixed duration, they could be terminated early; and they may be renegotiated on less favorable terms or may not be renewed at all by the other party. We must, therefore, seek additional contracts with third parties on an ongoing basis to sustain and grow our business. We expect to face continuing and increased competition for the technology products and services we provide, and there is no assurance that the parties with which we currently have contracts will continue or extend current contracts on the same or more favorable terms, or that we will obtain alternative or additional contracts for our technology products and services. As we have experienced over the past several years relating to our technology sales in China, the further loss of existing contracts, the failure to enter new contracts, or the deterioration of customer creditworthiness or the terms in our contracts with third parties could continue to materially harm our operating results, financial condition, and cash flow.  Nearly all of our contracts in which we provide to another party services or rights to use our technology include some form of obligation by us to indemnify the other party for certain liabilities and losses incurred by them, including liabilities resulting from third party claims for damages that arise out of the use of our technology. These indemnification terms provide us with certain procedural safeguards, including the right to control the defense of the indemnified party. We have in the past incurred costs to defend and settle such claims. Claims against which we may be obligated to defend others pursuant to our contracts could in the future result in payments that could materially harm our business and financial results.  In our Games segment, we rely on third-party platforms to distribute our games and collect revenue from players. We are subject to the standard terms and conditions that these platform providers have for application developers, which govern the content, promotion, distribution, operation of games and other applications on their platforms, as well as the terms of the payment processing services provided by the platforms, and which the platform providers can change unilaterally on short notice or without notice. If our platform providers do not perform their obligations in accordance with our platform agreements, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Moreover, Internet-connected devices and operating systems controlled by third parties increasingly contain features that allow device users to disable functionality that allows for the delivery of advertising on their devices, including through Apples Identifier for Advertising, or IDFA, or Googles Advertising ID, or AAID, for Android devices. Device and browser manufacturers may include or expand these features as part of their standard device specifications. For example, Apple's upcoming iOS update is expected to require app users to affirmatively opt in for their IDFA to be accessed by an app. In the likely event that a significant percentage of players decline to opt in, our ability to run effective user acquisition campaigns may be challenged potentially causing our spending to increase, and our advertising revenue may decline, thus harming our financial results.  Our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate, which may contribute to weakness or volatility in our stock price.  The trading price for our common stock has been in steady decline for many years, though, particularly more recently, has also been vulnerable to significant volatility caused by general market conditions or unusual stock-specific trading activity. There can be no assurance that our common stock will not experience additional, and potentially more significant, volatility in the future caused by unpredictable external factors. In addition, as a result of the rapidly changing markets in which we compete, and restructuring, impairment and other one-time events specific to us, our operating results may fluctuate or decline from period to period, which may contribute to weakness or volatility in our stock price. Moreover, the general difficulty in forecasting our operating results and identifying meaningful performance metrics, especially when factoring in our growth initiatives, could result in actual results that differ materially from expected results, again causing weakness and volatility in our stock price. Compounding these internal factors are external factors, such as the significant instability in global financial markets experienced over the past year, that will impact our operating results and stock price, potentially driving our stock price to record lows as occurred in 2020 or to significant activity levels as occurred in early 2021.  The difficulty in forecasting our operating results may also cause over or under investment in certain growth initiatives, as such investment is often planned based on expected financial results, thus causing more severe fluctuations in operating results and, likely, further volatility in our stock price.  Further, because our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we must meet Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, in particular, financial requirements that include maintaining a minimum bid price of at least  1.00. In April 2020, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Global Market indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period from March 11, 2020 to April 23, 2020, we did not meet the minimum bid price of  1.00 per share required for continued listing on Nasdaq. In June 2020, we received a second letter from Nasdaq Staff indicating that we had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450 a  1  based on its determination that the closing bid price of our common stock had been at  1.00 per share or greater for the 10 business days from May 15 to May 29, 2020. Although we are currently in compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and have received no contradictory notification from Nasdaq, our stock price could again fall below the  1.00 minimum as a result of valuation pressure, stock-specific trading activity or general declines in the stock market. We regularly monitor our  compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements, and, as necessary, our Board will consider the implementation of various measures intended to support continued compliance.  Any impairment to our goodwill, definite-lived, and right-of-use operating lease assets could result in a material charge to our earnings.  In accordance with GAAP, we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis or more frequently in the event of certain indications of possible impairment. We review definite-lived and operating lease assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting units fair value, changes in our operating plans and forecasts, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, a significant sustained decline in our market capitalization and other factors. If we were to determine that an impairment had occurred, we would be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material negative, and unanticipated, impact on our financial results.  Continued loss of revenue from our subscription services is likely to cause further harm to our operating results.  Our operating results have been and will continue to be adversely impacted by the loss of subscription revenue related to our more traditional products and services. Subscribers cancel their subscriptions to our services for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the services sufficiently or that the service does not provide enough value, a lack of attractive or exclusive content generally or as compared with competitive service offerings, or because customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. Revenue from our SuperPass subscription service, for example, has continued to decline over several periods, due to changes in consumer preferences and changes on our part to focus on other products and services we offer, and we expect this trend to continue.  Difficulty recruiting and retaining key personnel could significantly impair our operations or jeopardize our ability to meet our growth objectives.  Our success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of certain key personnel, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain them in the near term or recruit them in the future. In 2020, we experienced a significant level of executive turnover, as we have experienced in the past and could experience in the future, which could impact our ability to retain key personnel. Also, qualified individuals are in high demand and competition for such qualified personnel in our industry, particularly engineering talent, is extremely intense, and we may incur significant costs to attract or retain them. Changes in immigration or other policies in the U.S. or other jurisdictions that make it more difficult to hire and retain key talent, or to assign individuals to any of our locations as needed to meet business needs, could adversely affect our ability to attract key talent or deploy individuals as needed, and thereby adversely affect our business and financial results. Further, repeated restructuring of our businesses and related cost-reduction efforts, as well as declines and volatility in our stock price, have caused instability in our workforce that makes it more difficult to retain and recruit key personnel. Given these factors, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the key personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.  Acquisitions and divestitures involve costs and risks that could harm our business and impair our ability to realize potential benefits from these transactions.  As part of our business strategy, we have acquired and sold technologies and businesses in the past and expect that we will continue to do so in the future. The failure to adequately manage transaction costs and address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by acquisitions and divestitures of technology and businesses could harm our business and prevent us from realizing the benefits of these transactions. In addition, we may identify and acquire target companies, but those companies may not be complementary to our current operations and may not leverage our existing infrastructure or operational experience, which may increase the risks associated with completing acquisitions.  For example, our January 18, 2019 acquisition of a controlling interest in Napster represented a significant acquisition for RealNetworks. To effectuate the acquisition and incorporate Napster's financial results into our financial statements, we incurred significant transaction-related costs throughout fiscal year 2019 and early in 2020. Moreover, the 2020 sale of our Napster stake in connection with the merger of Napster and MelodyVR resulted in further significant transaction-related expenses, certain ongoing indemnification obligations, and the payment of a portion of proceeds to a third party.  Transaction-related costs and financial risks related to completed and potential future purchase or sale transactions may harm our financial position, reported operating results, or stock price. Previous acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization of purchased technology, amortization of acquired identifiable intangible assets and incurring charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are reflected in our operating expenses. New acquisitions and any potential additional future impairment of the value of purchased assets, including goodwill, could have a material negative impact on our future operating results. In compliance with GAAP, we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that our goodwill or definite-lived assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future revenue and cash flow estimates due to changes in our forecasts, and  unfavorable changes to valuation multiples and discount rates due to changes in the market. If we were to conclude that any of these assets were impaired, we would have to recognize an impairment charge that could materially impact our financial results.  Purchase and sale transactions also involve operational risks that could harm our existing operations or prevent realization of anticipated benefits from a transaction. These operational risks include   difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, information systems, and or personnel of the acquired company;  retaining key management or employees of the acquired company;  entrance into unfamiliar markets, industry segments, or types of businesses;  operating, managing and integrating acquired businesses in remote locations or in countries in which we have little or no prior experience;  diversion of management time and other resources from existing operations;  impairment of relationships with employees, affiliates, advertisers or content providers of our business or acquired business;  assumption of known and unknown liabilities of the acquired company, including intellectual property claims; and  potential impacts to our system of internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures.  Risks Related to Regulations and Other External Factors  Government regulation of the Internet, facial recognition technology, artificial intelligence and other related technologies is evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  We are subject to regulations and laws specific to the marketing, sale and delivery of goods and services. These laws and regulations, which continue to evolve, cover taxation, user privacy, data collection and protection, copyrights, electronic contracts, sales procedures, automatic subscription renewals, credit card processing procedures, consumer protections, digital games distribution, broadband Internet access and content restrictions. We cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction, as it is not entirely clear how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as privacy, taxation and consumer protection apply or will be enforced with respect to the products and services we sell. Moreover, as Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation and or enforcement efforts by federal, state and foreign agencies and the prospects for private litigation claims related to our data collection, privacy policies or other e-commerce practices become more likely. In addition, the adoption of any laws or regulations or the imposition of other legal requirements that adversely affect our ability to market, sell, and deliver our products and services could decrease our ability to offer or customer demand for our service offerings, resulting in lower revenue. Moreover, in the U.S., certain states have and more states may impose stricter privacy laws that may impact accepted business practices. We cannot provide assurance that the changes that we have adopted to our business practices will be compliant or that new compliance frameworks such as this will not have a negative impact on our financial results.  In addition, through the operation of our SAFR product, we are subject to regulations and laws generally and specifically applicable to the provision of facial recognition technology. New laws and regulations are under discussion and those that exist are untested, thus we cannot guarantee that we have been or will be fully compliant in every jurisdiction. Moreover, the voluntary development of norms, standards, and best practices by companies providing facial recognition and similar technology could require modifications to our technology or practices that may be costly or incompatible with our financial model. Moreover, as we pursue further sales of our SAFR product to governmental agencies, such as the Small Business Innovation Research  SBIR  contracts with the U.S. Air Force in 2020, we may become subject to more extensive contracting rules and standards.  Future regulations, or changes in laws and regulations or their existing interpretations or applications, could require us to further change our business practices, raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business and result in additional historical or future liabilities for us, resulting in adverse impacts on our business and our operating results.  As a consumer-facing business, we receive complaints from our customers regarding our consumer marketing efforts and our customer service practices. Some of these customers may also complain to government agencies, and from time to time, those agencies have made inquiries to us about these practices. In addition, we may receive complaints or inquiries directly from governmental agencies that have not been prompted by consumers. We cannot provide assurance that governmental agencies will not bring future claims, as they have on occasion in the past, regarding our marketing, or consumer services or other practices.  We face financial and operational risks associated with doing business in non-U.S. jurisdictions and operating a global business, that have in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  A material portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the U.S. and most of our employees are located outside of the U.S. Consequently, our business and operations depend significantly on global and national economic conditions and on  applicable trade regulations and tariffs. For example, our business in China could be negatively affected by an actual or perceived lack of stability or consistency in U.S.-China trade policy. The growth of our business is also dependent in part on successfully managing our international operations. Our non-U.S. sales, purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, many of which are outside our control, including the following   periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions;  price and currency exchange controls;  fluctuation in the relative values of currencies;  difficulty in repatriating funds, whether as a result of tax laws or otherwise;  compliance with current and changing tax laws, and the coordination of compliance with U.S. tax laws and the laws of any of the jurisdictions in which we do business;  difficulties protecting intellectual property;  compliance with labor laws and other laws governing employees;  local labor disputes;  changes in trading policies, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, or the termination or renegotiation of existing trade agreements;  impact of changes in immigration or other policies impacting our ability to attract, hire, and retain key talent;  potential implications resulting from the outbreak of disease on a global scale or localized in countries in which we do business or have employees; and  difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, collecting accounts receivable, and managing suppliers, distributors and representatives.  Because consumers may consider the purchase of our digital entertainment products and services to be a discretionary expenditure, their decision whether to purchase our products and services may be influenced by macroeconomic factors that affect consumer spending such as unemployment, access to credit, negative financial news, and declines in income. In addition, mobile telecommunication carriers and other business partners may reduce their business or advertising spending with us or for our products and services they distribute to users in the face of adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as financial market volatility, government austerity programs, tight credit, and declines in asset values. We have in the past recorded material asset impairment charges due in part to weakness in the global economy, and we may need to record additional impairments to our assets in future periods in the event of renewed weakness and uncertainty in the global or a relevant national economy. Accordingly, any significant weakness in the national and or global economy could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a negative manner.  Our international operations involve risks inherent in doing business globally, including difficulties in managing operations due to distance, language, cultural differences, local economic conditions, outbreak of diseases, different or conflicting laws and regulations, taxes, and exchange rate fluctuations. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is typically the local currency of the country in which each subsidiary operates. We translate our subsidiaries revenues into U.S. dollars in our financial statements, and continued volatility in foreign exchange rates may result in lower reported revenue or net assets in future periods. If we do not effectively manage any of the risks inherent in running our international businesses, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. As another example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel and work restrictions globally, and may further disrupt our ability to produce and sell products. We continue to monitor the impacts of the pandemic to our business, as well as rapidly evolving expectations regarding its severity and duration. We are unable to predict the full effects of this pandemic on our operations and financial results.  Our business is conducted in accordance with existing international trade relationships, and trade laws and regulations. Changes in geopolitical relationships and laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, such as the recent rise in protectionist politics and economic nationalism, could create uncertainty regarding our ability to operate and conduct commercial relationships in affected jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural or human-caused disasters. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition.  We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights or leverage our technology assets, and may face risks associated with third-party claims relating to intellectual property rights associated with our products and services.  Our ability to compete across our businesses partly depends on the superiority, uniqueness and value of our technology, including both internally developed technology and technology licensed from third parties. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties, and protective contractual provisions. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not assure our ownership rights in our intellectual property, protect or enhance the competitive position of our products, services and technology, or effectively prevent misappropriation of our technology.  From time to time, we receive claims and inquiries from third parties alleging that our technology used in our business may infringe the third parties proprietary rights. These claims, even if not meritorious, could force us to make significant investments of time, attention and money in defense, and give rise to monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. We may be forced to litigate, to enforce or defend our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the validity and scope of other parties' proprietary rights in intellectual property. To resolve or avoid such disputes, we may also be forced to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms or redesign our product features, services and technology to avoid actual or claimed infringement or misappropriation of technology. Any such dispute would likely be costly and distract our management, and the outcome of any such dispute  such as additional licensing arrangements or redesign efforts  could fail to improve our business prospects or otherwise harm our business or financial results.  Nearly all of our contracts by which we provide to another party services or rights to use our technology include some form of obligation by us to indemnify the other party for certain liabilities and losses incurred by them, including liabilities resulting from third party claims for damages that arise out of the use of our technology. Claims against which we may be obligated to defend others pursuant to our contracts expose us to the same risks and adverse consequences described above regarding claims we may receive directly alleging that our trademarks or technology used in our business may infringe a third party's proprietary rights.  Disputes regarding the validity and scope of patents or the ownership of technologies and rights associated with streaming media, digital distribution, and online businesses are common and likely to arise in the future. We also routinely receive challenges to our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property that we are using in our business activities. We are likely to continue to receive claims of third parties against us, alleging contract breaches, infringement of copyrights or patents, trademark rights, trade secret rights or other proprietary rights, or alleging unfair competition or violations of privacy rights.  Our business and operating results will suffer and we may be subject to market risk and legal liability if our systems or networks fail, become unavailable, unsecured or perform poorly so that current or potential users do not have adequate access to our products, services and websites.  Our ability to provide our products and services to our customers and operate our business depends on the continued operation and security of our information systems and networks and those of our service providers. A significant or repeated reduction in the performance, security or availability of our information systems and network infrastructure or that of our service providers could harm our ability to conduct our business, and harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain users, customers, advertisers and content providers. Many of our products are interactive Internet applications that by their very nature require communication between a client and server to operate.  We sell many of our products and services through online sales transactions directly with consumers, and their credit card information is collected and stored by our payment processors. The systems of our third party service providers may not prevent future improper access or disclosure of credit card information or personally identifiable information. We have an extensive privacy policy concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data involved in interactions between our client, third party payment providers, and server products. A security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information, or any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policy or existing or new privacy legislation, could harm our reputation, impact the market for our products and services, or subject us to litigation. We have on occasion experienced system errors and failures that caused interruption in availability of products or content or an increase in response time. Problems with our systems and networks, or the third party systems and networks that we utilize, could result from a failure to adequately maintain and enhance these systems and networks, natural disasters and similar events, power failures, intentional actions to disrupt systems and networks and many other causes. Many of our services do not currently have fully redundant systems or a formal disaster recovery plan, and we may not have adequate business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur from a system outage.  Changes in regulations applicable to the Internet and e-commerce that increase the taxes on the services we provide could materially harm our business and operating results.  As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing taxation by state, local or foreign tax authorities becomes more likely. For example, taxation of electronically delivered products and services or other charges imposed by government agencies may also be imposed. We collect transactional taxes and we believe we are compliant and current in all jurisdictions where we have a collection obligation for transaction taxes. Any regulation imposing greater taxes or other fees for products and services could result in a decline in the sale of products and services and the viability of those products and services, harming our business and operating results. A successful assertion by one or more states or foreign tax authorities that we should collect and remit sales or other taxes on the sale of our products or services could result in substantial liability for past sales.  In those countries where we have a tax obligation, we collect and remit value added tax, or VAT, on sales of electronically supplied services provided to European Union residents. The collection and remittance of VAT subjects us to additional currency fluctuation risks.  Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation or changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the SEC, and new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting standards and practices have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Moreover, our financial statements require the application of judgments and estimates regarding a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, and the acquisition method of accounting and its related estimated fair value amounts. Changes in accounting standards or practices, or in our judgments and estimates underlying accounting standards and practices, could harm and or materially impact our operating results and or financial condition. Changes to existing accounting rules or to our judgments and estimates underlying those rules could materially impact our reported operating results and financial condition.  We may be subject to additional income tax assessments and changes in applicable tax regulations could adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, income taxes payable, and net deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical financial statements. An audit or litigation can result in significant additional income taxes payable in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Risks Related to our Governance and Capital Structure  Our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer beneficially owns 38.5  of our common stock, which gives him significant control over certain major decisions on which our shareholders may vote or which may discourage an acquisition of us.  Robert Glaser, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns 38.5  of our common stock. As a result, Mr. Glaser and his affiliates will have significant influence to   elect or defeat the election of our directors;  amend or prevent amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws;  effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and  control the outcome of any other matter submitted to the shareholders for vote.  Furthermore, on February 10, 2020, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Mr. Glaser pursuant to which Mr. Glaser invested approximately  10.0 million in RealNetworks in exchange for the issuance to him of approximately 8 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, par value  0.001 per share. The rights, preferences, limitations, and powers of the Series B Preferred Stock are set forth in and governed by the designation of rights and preferences of Series B Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington. Those rights, preferences, limitations, and powers include the right to proportional adjustment and the right to any dividends or distributions declared with regard to our common stock, but the Series B Preferred Stock has no voting or consent rights, has no liquidation preference, has no preferred dividend, and has limitations on transferability. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of our common stock, however no conversion is permitted in the event that it would cause Mr. Glasers beneficial ownership of our common stock to exceed the 38.5  threshold set forth in our shareholder rights plan dated November 30, 2018.  The stock ownership of Mr. Glaser may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of RealNetworks, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.  Provisions of our charter documents, shareholder rights plan, and Washington law could discourage our acquisition by a third party.  Our articles of incorporation provide for a strategic transactions committee of the board of directors. Without the prior approval of this committee, and subject to certain limited exceptions, the board of directors does not have the authority to   adopt a plan of merger;  authorize the sale, lease, exchange or mortgage of assets representing more than 50  of the book value of our assets prior to the transaction or on which our long-term business strategy is substantially dependent;  authorize our voluntary dissolution; or  take any action that has the effect of any of the above.  Mr. Glaser has special rights under our articles of incorporation to appoint or remove members of the strategic transactions committee at his discretion that could make it more difficult for RealNetworks to be sold or to complete another change of control transaction without Mr. Glasers consent. RealNetworks has also entered into an agreement providing Mr. Glaser with certain contractual rights relating to the enforcement of our charter documents and Mr. Glasers roles and authority within RealNetworks. These rights and his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors, together with Mr. Glasers significant beneficial ownership, create unique potential for concentrated influence of Mr. Glaser over potentially material transactions involving RealNetworks and decisions regarding the future strategy and leadership of RealNetworks.  We adopted a shareholder rights plan in December 1998, which was amended and restated in December 2008, amended in April 2016 and February 2018, and again amended and restated in November 2018. The plan provides that shares of our common stock have associated preferred stock purchase rights, the exercise of which would make the acquisition of RealNetworks by a third party more expensive to that party, having the effect of discouraging third parties from acquiring RealNetworks without the approval of our board of directors, which has the power to redeem these rights and prevent their exercise.  Washington law imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders. The foregoing provisions of our charter documents, shareholder rights plan, our agreement with Mr. Glaser, and Washington law, as well as our charter provisions that provide for a classified board of directors and the availability of blank check preferred stock, could have the effect of making it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions may therefore have the effect of limiting the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview   RealNetworks invented the streaming media category in 1995 and continues to build on its foundation of digital media expertise and innovation, creating a new generation of products and services to enhance and secure our daily lives. We manage our business and report revenue and operating income  loss  in three segments   1  Consumer Media  2  Mobile Services, and  3  Games.  Within our Consumer Media segment, revenue is derived from the software licensing of our video compression and enhancement, or codec, technologies, including primarily from our prior-generation codec RealMedia Variable Bitrate, or RMVB, as well as our newer codec technology, RealMedia High Definition, or RMHD. We also generate revenue from the sale of our PC-based RealPlayer products, including RealPlayer Plus and related products. These products and services are delivered directly to consumers and through partners, such as OEMs and mobile device manufacturers.  Our Mobile Services business generates revenue primarily from the sale of subscription services, which include our intercarrier messaging service and ringback tones, as well as through software licenses for the integration of our RealTimes platform and certain system implementations. We generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales within our Mobile Services business to a few mobile carriers. Our Mobile Services segment also includes our computer vision platform, SAFR, which includes facial recognition technology that leverages artificial intelligence-based machine learning.  Our Games business generates revenue primarily through the development, publishing, and distribution of casual games under the GameHouse and Zylom brands. Games are offered via mobile devices, digital downloads, and subscription play. We derive revenue from player purchases of in-game virtual goods within our free-to-play games and from advertising on games sites. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of individual games and subscription offerings.  RealNetworks allocates to its Consumer Media, Mobile Services, and Games reportable segments certain corporate expenses which are directly attributable to supporting these businesses, including, but not limited to, a portion of finance, IT, legal, human resources and headquarters facilities. Remaining expenses, which are not directly attributable to supporting these businesses, are reported as corporate items. These corporate items also can include restructuring charges and stock compensation expense.  As described in Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, RealNetworks acquired an additional 42  interest in Rhapsody International, Inc.  doing business as Napster  on January 18, 2019 bringing our ownership of Napster's outstanding stock to 84 , thus giving us a majority voting interest. For fiscal periods following the closing of the acquisition, we consolidated Napster's financial results into our financial statements, where Napster was reported as a separate segment. RealNetworks entered into a Support Agreement dated August 25, 2020 by and among its 84 -owned subsidiary, Napster, and MelodyVR Group PLC, referred to as MelodyVR, an English public limited company. The Support Agreement was executed in connection with an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or Merger Agreement, by and among Napster, MelodyVR, and a wholly owned subsidiary of MelodyVR that effectuated the merger. The Merger Agreement called for the merger of MelodyVR's merger sub  with and into Napster, with Napster surviving and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of MelodyVR. Other than as Securityholder Representative, RealNetworks is not a party to the Merger Agreement.  The transaction closed on December 30, 2020 at which time MelodyVR assumed Napster's assets and liabilities, primarily relating to music licensing. MelodyVR paid consideration of approximately  26 million to certain holders of debt and equity of Napster, comprised of  12 million in cash, shares of MelodyVR, and a  3 million 18-month indemnity escrow. The shares of MelodyVR that RealNetworks received may not be sold or transferred, except in limited circumstances, for a period of one year. Certain proceeds from the transaction were used to fully repay the advance to Napster on the revolving line of credit, as discussed in Note 9. Debt, pay Napster's transaction expenses, and pay amounts to certain of Napster's common stockholders. The final value to RealNetworks from the transaction is subject to the eventual payout of the indemnity escrow.  Effective on the execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger on August 25, 2020, Napster was treated as discontinued operations for accounting and disclosure purposes. As such, Napster's operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and financial condition as of December 31, 2019 have been recast to conform to this presentation. Upon the close of the transaction, a gain on sale of approximately  1.9 million was recognized in discontinued operations.  COVID-19  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. As the virus spread throughout the U.S. and the world, authorities implemented numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations, and shutdowns. In addition to the pandemic's widespread impact on public health and global society, reactions to the pandemic as well as measures taken to contain the virus have caused significant turmoil to the global economy and financial markets. Moreover, similar to other companies, we have taken steps to support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, which include working remotely and learning to operate our business in a fundamentally different way.  As the pandemic and containment measures generally evolved throughout 2020, we have had to reevaluate our operating plans, resulting in some significant pivots for our growth initiatives. Moreover, as we continue to operate our business as efficiently as possible, we have taken steps to more aggressively reduce costs and reallocate resources. We are unable to predict the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows for fiscal 2021, due to the numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effects to our businesses and adjust our plans as needed.  Financial Results  As of December 31, 2020, we had  23.9 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents compared to  8.5 million as of December 31, 2019. The 2020 increase in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2019 was primarily due to  10.0 million in cash proceeds from the first quarter 2020 issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and proceeds from a promissory note issued in the second quarter of 2020 pursuant to the Payment Protection Program  PPP  of the CARES Act, with RealNetworks receiving  2.9 million. A subsidiary of RealNetworks, Scener, also received  2.1 million in the third quarter of 2020, in return for issuing SAFE Notes, as described in Note 5. Fair Value Measurements. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we received cash proceeds from the sale of Napster as described in Note 4. Acquisitions and Dispositions. The increase was partially offset by funds used in our operations, which totaled  8.1 million.  The following discussion reflects RealNetworks' results from continuing operations. Consolidated results of operations were as follows  dollars in thousands    2020 2019 2020-2019  Change    Change  Total revenue   68,062   65,802   2,260 3    Cost of revenue 16,465 17,226  761   4     Gross profit 51,597 48,576 3,021 6    Gross margin 76   74   2    Total operating expenses 56,621 75,640  19,019   25     Operating loss    5,024     27,064    22,040 81    2020 compared with 2019  In 2020, our consolidated revenue increased by  2.3 million, or 3 . The increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in our Games segment of  3.1 million, which was partially offset by decreases of  0.6 million in Consumer Media revenue and  0.3 million in Mobile Services revenue. See below for further information regarding fluctuations by segment. Gross margin increased to 76  from 74  due to the combination of higher revenues and cost reduction efforts.  Operating expenses decreased by  19.0 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to reductions to the contingent consideration liability of  9.6 million, lower salaries and other people related expenses of  7.2 million, decreased professional fees of  1.1 million, and lower facility costs of  0.9 million. See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements for additional information on the change in the contingent consideration liability.  Segment Operating Results  Consumer Media  Consumer Media segment results of operations were as follows  dollars in thousands    2020 2019 2020-2019  Change    Change  Total revenue   12,581   13,170    589   4     Cost of revenue 2,273 3,031  758   25     Gross profit 10,308 10,139 169 2    Gross margin 82   77   5    Total operating expenses 8,889 11,186  2,297   21     Operating income  loss    1,419    1,047    2,466 NM  Total Consumer Media revenue decreased by  0.6 million, or 4  as compared to the prior year, due to decreased software license revenues of  0.6 million and decreased subscription services of  0.6 million, partially offset by increased product sales of  0.5 million from RealPlayer Plus. Advertising and other revenue increased  0.1 million when compared to the prior year due to the non-recurring recognition of previously deferred third-party software product distribution revenue in the amount of  0.6 million, which was largely offset by lower advertising revenue.  Software License  For our software license revenues, the  0.6 million decrease was primarily due to the recognition of revenue on a contract that was effectuated and fully recognized for  1.0 million in 2019. Also contributing to the decrease was the timing of shipments and payments for approximately  0.9 million in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by renewals from existing customers in 2020. The bulk of these licenses for our codec technology are with companies based in China and, in the near term, it is possible we may see continued pressure on pricing and renewals, and potential further declines in sales.  Subscription Services  For our subscription services revenues, the decrease of  0.6 million was primarily due to further declines in our legacy subscription products, which we expect to continue.  Cost of revenue decreased by  0.8 million, or 25 . This was primarily due to reductions in salaries and other people related expenses of  0.7 million.  Operating expenses decreased by  2.3 million, or 21 , compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, from headcount reductions, of  1.9 million as well as lower infrastructure costs of  0.5 million.  Mobile Services  Mobile Services segment results of operations were as follows  dollars in thousands    2020 2019 2020-2019  Change    Change  Total revenue   26,889   27,143    254   1     Cost of revenue 6,725 7,500  775   10     Gross profit 20,164 19,643 521 3    Gross margin 75   72   3    Total operating expenses 24,787 29,340  4,553   16     Operating loss    4,623     9,697    5,074 52    Mobile Services revenue declined by  0.3 million, or 1 , and was primarily driven by a decrease of  2.2 million in subscription services revenue, offset by an increase of  2.0 million in software license revenue.  Software license  For our software license revenues, the  2.0 million increase was primarily the result of revenue from sales of our SAFR product, with a  1.9 million increase over the prior year.  Subscription service  For our subscription services, the  2.2 million decrease was driven by fewer subscribers to our ringback tones resulting in a decrease in revenue of  2.7 million. These decreases were offset by an increase in revenue from our intercarrier messaging platform business of  0.4 million.  Cost of revenue decreased by  0.8 million or 10  as compared to the prior year, due primarily to reductions in salaries and benefits of  0.6 million related to headcount reductions.  Operating expenses decreased by  4.6 million or 16  primarily due to decreased salaries, benefits and other people related costs of  2.8 million, lower marketing costs of  1.4 million, and lower infrastructure costs of  0.7 million.  Games  Games segment results of operations were as follows  dollars in thousands    2020 2019 2020-2019  Change    Change  Total revenue   28,592   25,489   3,103 12    Cost of revenue 7,451 6,975 476 7    Gross profit 21,141 18,514 2,627 14    Gross margin 74   73   1    Total operating expenses 19,936 20,220  284   1     Operating income  loss    1,205    1,706    2,911 NM  Games revenue increased by  3.1 million, or 12  as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases of  4.4 million in product sales revenues and other revenues, partially offset by a decrease of  1.3 million in subscription services revenues, described more fully below. Our Games segment has shifted its focus toward free-to-play games that offer in-game purchases of virtual goods, the revenue from which is included within product sales, and away from premium mobile games that require a one-time purchase or subscription.  Subscription Services  Our subscription sales decreased  1.3 million as a result of lower subscribers in 2020 as compared to 2019.  Product sales  Our product sales increased  4.1 million as a result of higher in-game purchases of  6.5 million compared to the prior-year period, offset by lower sales of games of  2.4 million as we have shifted toward free-to-play games that offer in-game purchases of virtual goods and away from premium mobile games that require a one-time purchase.  Advertising and other  Our advertising and other revenues increased  0.4 million as compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of offering more in-game advertising within our free-to-play games, partially offset by decreases in advertising revenue from premium mobile games.  Cost of revenue increased by  0.5 million, or 7 , due to higher app store fees of  1.0 million, partially offset by lower publisher license and service royalties.  Operating expenses decreased by  0.3 million, primarily due to lower salaries and other people related costs of  1.0 million, professional services fees and development costs of  1.0 million and infrastructure expenses of  0.2 million, partially offset by higher marketing fees of  1.9 million.

The decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and other people related costs of  1.6 million and lower professional service fees of  0.6 million. The overall decrease was also impacted by  9.6 million related to the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability. See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements for additional information.  Consolidated Operating Expenses  Our operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs including stock-based compensation, consulting fees associated with product development, sales commissions, amortization of certain intangible assets capitalized in our acquisitions, professional service fees, advertising costs, restructuring charges, and lease exit costs. Operating expenses were as follows  dollars in thousands    2020 2019 2020-2019  Change    Change  Research and development   24,319   27,850    3,531   13     Sales and marketing 21,042 23,016  1,974   9     General and administrative 17,331 21,820  4,489   21     Fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liability  8,600  1,000  9,600  NM  Restructuring and other charges 2,529 1,954 575 29    Total consolidated operating expenses   56,621   75,640    19,019   25     Research and development expenses decreased by  3.5 million, or 13 , in the year ended 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decrease in salaries and other people related costs of  2.0 million, lower professional service fees and development costs of  1.2 million and lower infrastructure costs of  0.4 million.  Sales and marketing expenses decreased by  2.0 million, or 9 , in the year ended 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in salaries and other people related costs of  2.9 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher marketing and professional fees of  0.8 million.  General and administrative expenses decreased by  4.5 million, or 21 , in the year ended 2020, compared with 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and other people related costs of  2.4 million, lower professional fees of  1.1 million and lower facility expenses of  0.8 million.  The fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration liability changed by  9.6 million in the year ended 2020, compared with 2019. See Note 5. Fair Value Measurements for additional information.  Restructuring and other charges consist of costs associated with the ongoing reorganization of our business operations and our ongoing expense re-alignment efforts. For additional details on these charges, see Note 10. Restructuring and Other Charges.

Debt.  Gain on equity and other investments, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes unrealized gains on equity securities of  0.7 million, partially offset by net losses in equity investments of  0.6 million. Gain on equity and other investments, net for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes  12.3 million related to RealNetworks' gain on consolidation of Napster, as described in more detail in Note 4. Acquisitions and Dispositions.  The fluctuation in Other income  expense , net primarily relates to foreign exchange gains and losses.  Income Taxes  During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized income tax expense from continuing operations of  0.1 million and  0.7 million, respectively, related to U.S. and foreign income taxes.  In general, the amount of tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations is determined without regard to the tax effects of other categories of income or loss, such as discontinued operations. However, an exception to the general rule is provided in Topic 740 when there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and there are items charged or credited to other  categories, including discontinued operations, in the current year. Pursuant to Topic 740, the gain from discontinued operations was considered in determining the  0.1 million tax expense allocated to the loss from continuing operations.  The income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was largely the result of foreign withholding taxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions.  We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered based upon our consideration of many factors, including the current economic climate, our expectations of future taxable income, our ability to project such income, and the appreciation of our investments and other assets. We maintain a partial valuation allowance of  128.3 million for our deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding their realization as of December 31, 2020. The net decrease in the valuation allowance since December 31, 2019 of  32.5 million was the result of a decrease in current year deferred tax assets, mainly related to the disposition of Napster, for which the Company maintained a valuation allowance.  We generate income in a number of foreign jurisdictions, some of which have higher tax rates and some of which have lower tax rates relative to the U.S. federal statutory rate. Changes to the blend of income between jurisdictions with higher or lower effective tax rates than the U.S. federal statutory rate could affect our effective tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2020, decreases in tax expense from income generated in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in comparison to the U.S. federal statutory rate were offset by increases in tax expense from income generated in foreign jurisdictions having comparable, or higher tax rates in comparison to the U.S. federal statutory rate.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, RealNetworks had  0.7 million and  5.0 million in uncertain tax positions, respectively. The decrease in uncertain tax positions is primarily the result of the Napster Disposition, for which unrecognized tax positions were removed relating to federal research and development tax credit carryforward risks, as well as transfer pricing risks in certain foreign jurisdictions. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits are due to federal research and development tax credit carryforward risks. As of December 31, 2020, there are no unrecognized tax benefits remaining that would affect our effective tax rate if recognized, as the offset would increase the valuation allowance. We do not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months.  We file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the U.S. including federal, state and local, as well as foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for tax years before 2013 or state, local, or foreign income tax examinations for years before 1993. We are currently under audit by various states and foreign jurisdictions for certain tax years subsequent to 1993.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following summarizes working capital, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash  in thousands    December 31,  2020 2019  Working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents   1,148    5,808   Cash and cash equivalents 23,940 8,472  Restricted cash equivalents 1,630 4,880  The 2020 improvement in working capital from December 31, 2019 was primary due to the investment in MelodyVR received as proceeds on the sale of Napster, partially offset by the reclassification of the contingent consideration liability from other long-term liabilities to current liabilities.  Cash and cash equivalents increased  15.5 million from December 31, 2019 due to  10.0 million in cash proceeds from the first quarter 2020 issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, cash proceeds received from the sale of Napster during the fourth quarter of 2020, as described in Note 4. Acquisitions and Dispositions, proceeds of  2.9 million from the PPP promissory note, and issuance of SAFE Notes of  2.1 million. These increases were partially offset by cash used in operations.  The decrease in restricted cash equivalents is due to a reduction in the restricted amounts required by our amended Loan Agreement of  2.0 million and the release of restricted funds held for the corporate headquarters lease, which have been satisfied with a letter of credit. See Note 9. Debt for additional information on amendments to our revolving line of credit.  The following summarizes cash flow activity from continuing operations  in thousands    Years Ended December 31,  2020 2019  Cash used in operating activities    8,083     21,315   Cash provided by  used in  investing activities  408  11,324  Cash provided by financing activities 11,034 4,068  Cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss from continuing operations adjusted for certain non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain on equity and other investments, fair value adjustments to the  contingent consideration liability, loss on impairment of operating lease assets and the effect of changes in certain operating assets and liabilities.  Cash used in operating activities was  13.2 million lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. Cash used in operations was lower primarily due to our lower operating loss recorded for year 2020 compared to the prior year.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities of  0.4 million was primarily due to fixed asset purchases.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by investing activities of  11.3 million was due primarily to the net cash received from the Napster acquisition in January 2019. Our initial cash consideration paid at closing of  0.2 million was offset by the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on Napster's balance sheet at the acquisition date. The increase was offset in part by fixed asset purchases of  0.9 million.  Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 provided cash totaling  11.0 million. This cash inflow was primarily due to the issuance of Series B preferred stock of  10.0 million and proceeds of  2.9 million from the PPP promissory note, and the receipt by Scener, a subsidiary of RealNetworks, of  2.1 million from the issuance of SAFE Notes. These inflows were partially offset by repayment on our revolving credit facility of  3.9 million. See Note 9. Debt and Note 19. Related Party Transactions for additional details.  Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 provided cash totaling  4.1 million, which was primarily from borrowings on our revolving credit facility of  3.9 million. See Note 9. Debt for additional details.  While we currently have no planned significant capital expenditures for 2021 other than those in the ordinary course of business, we do have contractual commitments for future payments related to office leases. See Note 15. Leases for additional details.  RealNetworks is a party to a Loan Agreement with a third-party financial institution, as discussed in Note 9. Debt. Under the Agreement, as amended, borrowings may not exceed  6.5 million and are reduced by a  1.0 million standby letter of credit entered into with the bank in connection with certain lease agreements. At December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding draws on the revolving line of credit.  In February 2020, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Mr. Glaser, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of RealNetworks, pursuant to which Mr. Glaser invested approximately  10.0 million in RealNetworks in exchange for the issuance to him of 8,064,516 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting and is convertible into common stock on a one-to-one basis, provided, however, that no conversion is permitted in the event that such conversion would cause Mr. Glasers beneficial ownership of our common stock to exceed the 38.5  threshold set forth in our Second Amended and Restated Shareholder Rights Plan dated November 30, 2018. The Series B Preferred Stock has no liquidation preference and no preferred dividend.  In 2019, Mr. Glaser directly invested  0.8 million in one of our subsidiaries, Scener, in exchange for shares of preferred stock of that entity. The subsidiary is developing a platform that transforms the experience of viewing video entertainment into a social, connected playground. As of December 31, 2020, RealNetworks owned approximately 82  of the subsidiary's outstanding equity, and we consolidate its financial results into our financial statements. The financial results of the subsidiary are reported in our Consumer Media segment.  In the near term, we expect to see continued net negative cash flow from operating activities. We believe that our unrestricted current cash and cash equivalents and unused capacity on our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Notwithstanding this availability of cash and access to additional funding, management has considered and will continue to evaluate implementation of a variety of cash conservation measures.  In the future, we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing, or through other sources. Such sources of funding may or may not be available to us at commercially reasonable terms. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, in the future, we may enter into cash or stock acquisition transactions or other strategic transactions that could reduce cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to shareholders.  Contractual Obligations  We have contractual obligations for Long-term debt and for Long-term lease liabilities, both of which are recorded on our balance sheet. For details on the maturity of Long-term debt, please refer to Note 9. Debt and for future minimum lease payments please refer to Note 15. Leases. Please also refer to Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies. For income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of any related future payments. As of December 31, 2020, we had  0.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not maintain accruals associated with certain guarantees, as discussed in Note 17. Guarantees; those guarantee obligations constitute off-balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows   Revenue recognition;  Valuation of definite-lived assets, right-of-use operating lease assets, and goodwill; and  Accounting for income taxes.  Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue from contracts with customers as control of the promised good or service is transferred. Please refer to Note 3. Revenue Recognition for further details regarding our recognition policies.  Valuation of Definite-Lived Assets, Right-of-Use Operating Lease Assets, and Goodwill. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are measured at fair value under the purchase accounting method and any goodwill is recognized as the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value estimates are based upon estimates and assumptions relating to future revenues, cash flows, operating expenses and costs of capital. These estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including, but not limited to, the cash flows of long-term operating plans and risk-commensurate discount rates and cost of capital.  Our definite-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment. Definite-lived assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. We review definite-lived assets and right-of-use operating lease assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If definite-lived assets or right-of-use operating lease assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value.  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, in our fourth quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. As part of this test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the reporting unit's carrying amount including goodwill. If this assessment indicates impairment is more likely than not, we then compare the carrying value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, we then calculate the implied estimated fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of goodwill for the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to implied estimated value.  The impairment analysis of definite-lived assets, right-of-use operating lease assets, and goodwill may be based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue, cash flows, operating expenses, costs of capital and capital purchases. These estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including, but not limited to, the cash flows of our long-term operating plans, market and interest rate risk, and risk-commensurate discount rates and cost of capital. Significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows, or adverse changes in our business climate, among other factors, and their resulting impact on the estimates and assumptions relating to the value of our definite-lived, right-of-use lease, and goodwill assets could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future periods which could result in a significant impairment. While we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, due to their complexity and subjectivity, these estimates and assumptions could vary from period to period. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of future cash flows and related fair values of these assets and result in significant impairments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. For further discussion, please see the risk factor entitled,  Any impairment to our goodwill, definite-lived, and right-of-use operating lease assets could result in a material charge to our earnings  under Item 1A Risk Factors.  Accounting for Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. We must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current and deferred provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could materially impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.  Each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future sources of taxable income, and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance must be established. The establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income. In certain instances, changes in the valuation allowance may be allocated directly to the related components of shareholders' equity on the consolidated balance sheet. Factors we consider in making such an assessment include, but are not limited to, past performance and our expectation of future taxable income, macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry, existing contracts, our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately  8.4 million of the  23.9 million of cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. We have reevaluated our historical assertion that undistributed foreign earnings were indefinitely reinvested and for which deferred taxes were not provided. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act and as of December 31, 2020, we are no longer indefinitely reinvesting substantially all of the Company's foreign earnings outside of the U.S. As a result of this change, we have recorded deferred taxes of  0.9 million as of December 31, 2020 to reflect local country and foreign withholding taxes associated with a future repatriation of such foreign earnings.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A.  Risk Factors  You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the market price of our class A common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.  Risks Related to Our Business  Our quarterly operating results, revenues, and expenses may fluctuate significantly, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock  For many reasons, including those described below, our operating results, revenues, and expenses have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future from quarter to quarter. These fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our class A common stock.  Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, in part, as a result of     the size, timing, volume, and execution of significant orders and shipments;    fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, of which we have made significant purchases and in which we expect to continue to make significant purchases, and potential material impairment charges that may be associated therewith;    the mix of our offerings ordered by customers, including product licenses and cloud subscriptions, which can affect the extent to which revenue is recognized immediately or over future quarterly periods;    the timing of the release or delivery of new or enhanced offerings and market acceptance of new and enhanced offerings;    the timing of announcements of new offerings by us or our competitors;    changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;    the length of our sales cycles;    seasonal or other buying patterns of our customers;    changes in our operating expenses;    the impact of the coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic, or other future infectious disease pandemics, on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees, and business;    the timing of research and development projects;    utilization of our consulting and education services, which can be affected by delays or deferrals of customer implementation of our software;    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;    bilateral or multilateral trade tensions, which could affect our offerings in particular foreign markets;    our profitability and expectations for future profitability and their effect on our deferred tax assets and net income for the period in which any adjustment to our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be made;    increases or decreases in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits; and    changes in customer decision-making processes or customer budgets.  Limited Ability to Adjust Expenses. We base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter. For example, if our revenues in the future are not sufficient to offset our operating expenses, or we are unable to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any shortfall in anticipated revenue, we may incur operating losses.  Based on the above factors, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. It is possible that in one or more future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our class A common stock may fall.  We may not be able to regain or increase profitability in the future  We generated a net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and we may not be able to regain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our revenues are not sufficient to offset our operating expenses, or we are unable to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any shortfall in anticipated revenue, we may incur operating losses in future periods, our profitability may decrease, or we may cease to be profitable. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  As of December 31, 2020, we had  6.5 million of deferred tax assets, net of a  1.3 million valuation allowance. If we are unable to regain or increase profitability in the future, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets, which could result in a charge that would materially adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred.  We depend on revenue from a single software platform and related services as well as revenue from our installed customer base  Our revenue is derived from sales of our analytics software platform and related services. Although demand for analytics software has continued to grow, the market for analytics offerings continues to evolve. Resistance from consumer and privacy groups to commercial collection, use, and sharing of personal data has grown in recent years and our customers, potential customers, or the general public may perceive that use of our analytics software could violate individual privacy rights. In addition, increasing government restrictions on the collection, use, and transfer of personal data could impair the further growth of the market for analytics software, especially in foreign markets. Because we depend on revenue from a single software platform and related services, our business could be harmed by a decline in demand for, or in the adoption or prices of, our platform and related services as a result of, among other factors, any change in our pricing or packaging model, increased competition, maturation in the markets for our platform, or other risks described in this Annual Report. We also depend on our installed customer base for a substantial portion of our revenue. If our existing customers cancel or fail to renew their service contracts or fail to make additional purchases from us, our revenue could decrease and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.  A substantial customer shift in the deployment of the MicroStrategy platform from a product license model to a cloud subscription model could affect the timing of revenue recognition, reduce product licenses and product support revenues, and materially adversely affect our operating results  We offer our analytics platform in the form of a product license or a cloud subscription. The payment streams and revenue recognition timing for our product licenses are different from those for our cloud subscriptions. For product licenses, customers typically pay us a lump sum soon after entering into a license agreement, and we typically recognize product licenses revenue when control of the license is transferred to the customer. For cloud subscriptions, customers typically make periodic payments over the subscription period and we recognize subscription services revenues ratably over the subscription period. As a result, if a substantial number of current customers shift to, or new customers purchase, cloud subscriptions instead of product licenses, the resulting change in payment terms and revenue recognition may result in our recognizing less revenue in the reporting period in which the sale transactions are consummated than has been the case in prior periods, with more revenue being  recognized in future periods. This change in the timing of revenue recognition could materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows for the periods during which such a shift or change in purchasing occurs. Accordingly, in any particular reporting period, cloud subscription sales could negatively impact product license sales to our existing and prospective customers, which could reduce product licenses and product support revenues.  We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities  We are subject to income taxes and non-income taxes in a variety of domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Our future income tax liability could be materially adversely affected by earnings that are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates, earnings that are higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof  including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic . In addition, if we sold any of our bitcoin at prices greater than the cost basis of the bitcoin sold, we would incur a tax liability with respect to any gain recognized, and such tax liability could be material.  Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  OECD  to combat base erosion and profit shifting  BEPS . The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These changes, many of which have been adopted or are under active consideration by OECD members and or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.  In addition, in response to significant market volatility and disruptions to business operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented, and in the future may implement additional, changes to their tax rules. As part of the U.S. Congresss response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act  FFCR Act  and the CARES Act were enacted in March 2020. Both contain numerous tax provisions. Regulatory guidance under the Tax Act, FFCR Act, and CARES Act is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen the impact of these laws on our business and financial condition. It is also likely that the U.S. Congress will enact additional legislation in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which could have tax provisions that impact us. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, FFCR Act, or CARES Act. These changes in law could include modifications that have temporary effect or more permanent changes. The impact of these changes on us, our long-term tax planning, and our effective tax rate could be material.  Our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such reviews could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Moreover, as a multinational business, we have subsidiaries that engage in many intercompany transactions in a variety of tax jurisdictions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  We also have contingent tax liabilities that, in managements judgment, are not probable of assertion. If such unasserted contingent liabilities were to be asserted, or become probable of assertion, we may be required to record significant expenses and liabilities in the period in which these liabilities are asserted or become probable of assertion.  As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may materially affect our financial results in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.  We use channel partners and if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with them, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  In addition to our direct sales force, we use channel partners, such as system integrators, consulting firms, resellers, solution providers, managed service providers, OEMs, and technology companies, to license and support our offerings. For the year ended December 31, 2020, transactions by channel partners for which we recognized revenue accounted for 23.3  of our total product licenses revenues, and our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our ability to maintain these relationships. Our channel partners may offer customers the products and services of several different companies, including competing offerings, and we cannot be certain that they will prioritize or devote adequate resources to selling our offerings. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our channel partners, or if we experience a reduction in sales by our channel partners, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, we rely on our channel partners to operate in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements. If they fail to do so, we may need to incur significant costs in responding to investigations or enforcement actions or paying penalties assessed by the applicable authorities. We also rely on our channel partners to operate in accordance with the terms of their contractual agreements with us. For example, some of our agreements with our channel partners prescribe the terms and conditions pursuant to which they are authorized to resell or distribute our software and offer technical support and related services. If our channel partners do not comply with their contractual obligations to us, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  Our recognition of deferred revenue and advance payments is subject to future performance obligations and may not be representative of revenues for succeeding periods  Our deferred revenue and advance payments totaled  205.9 million as of December 31, 2020. The timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on various factors, including our performance of various service obligations.  Because of the possibility of customer changes or delays in customer development or implementation schedules or budgets, and the need for us to satisfactorily perform product support and other services, deferred revenue and advance payments at any particular date may not be representative of actual revenue for any succeeding period.  We may lose sales, or sales may be delayed, due to the long sales and implementation cycles of certain of our offerings, which could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results  The decision to purchase our offerings typically requires our customers to invest substantial time, money, personnel, and other resources, which can result in long sales cycles that can exceed nine months. These long sales cycles increase the risk that intervening events, such as the introduction of new offerings and changes in customer budgets and purchasing priorities, will affect the size, timing, and completion of an order. Even if an order is completed, the time and resources required to implement and integrate our offerings vary widely depending on customer needs and the complexity of deployment. If we lose sales or sales are delayed due to these long sales and implementation cycles, our revenues and operating results for that period may be materially adversely affected.  Our results in any particular period may depend on the number and volume of large transactions in that period and these transactions may involve lengthier, more complex, and more unpredictable sales cycles than other transactions  Larger, enterprise-level transactions often require considerably more resources, are often more complex to implement, and typically require additional management approval, which may result in a lengthier, more complex, and less predictable sales cycle and may increase the risk that an order is delayed or not brought to completion. We may also encounter greater competition and pricing pressure on these larger transactions, and our sales and delivery efforts may be more costly. The presence or absence of one or more large transactions in a particular period may have a material effect on our revenues and operating results for that period and may result in lower estimated revenues and earnings in future periods. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top three product licenses  transactions with recognized revenue totaled  15.3 million, or 17.6  of total product licenses revenues, compared to  5.4 million, or 6.2  of total product licenses revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Our offerings face intense competition, which may lead to lower prices for our offerings, reduced gross margins, loss of market share, and reduced revenue  The analytics market is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology. Within the analytics space, we compete with many different software vendors, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Qlik, Salesforce, and SAP. Our future success depends on our ability to differentiate our offerings and successfully compete across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Some of these factors include software deployment options; analytical, mobility, data discovery, and visualization capabilities; performance and scalability; the quality and reliability of our customer service and support; and brand recognition. Failure to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our offerings and materially adversely affect our revenue from both existing and prospective customers.  Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale, and marketing of their offerings than we can, such as offering certain analytics products free of charge when bundled with other products. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers, extensive industry and specialized business knowledge, and corresponding proprietary technologies that they can leverage. As a result, they may be able to prevent us from penetrating new accounts or expanding existing accounts.  Increased competition may lead to price cuts, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. The failure to compete successfully and meet the competitive pressures we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Current and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our potential customers by their expanded offerings and rapidly gain significant market share, which could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to sustain software maintenance revenues from our installed customer base. In addition, basic office productivity software suites, such as Microsoft Office, could evolve to offer advanced analysis and reporting capabilities that may reduce the demand for our analytics offerings.  Risks Related to Our Technology and Intellectual Property  If we are unable to develop and release new offerings and software enhancements to respond to rapid technological change, new customer requirements, or evolving industry standards in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  The market for our offerings is characterized by frequent new offerings and software enhancements in response to rapid technological change, new customer requirements, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new or enhanced offerings can quickly make existing ones obsolete. We believe our future success depends largely on our ability to continue to support popular operating systems and databases, maintain and improve our current offerings, rapidly develop new offerings and software enhancements that achieve market acceptance, maintain technological competitiveness, and meet an expanding range of customer requirements.  Analytics applications are inherently complex, and research and development can be costly and time consuming. In addition, customers may delay their purchasing decisions because they anticipate that new or enhanced versions of our offerings will soon become available or because of concerns regarding the complexity of migration or performance issues related to new offerings. We cannot be sure that we will succeed in developing, marketing, and delivering, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new or enhanced offerings that will achieve market acceptance. Moreover, even if our new offerings achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decline in revenues of our  existing offerings that is not fully matched by the new offerings revenue. This could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  We depend on technology licensed to us by third parties, and changes in or the discontinuances of such licenses could impair our software, delay implementation of our offerings, or force us to pay higher license fees  We license third-party technologies that are incorporated into or utilized by our existing offerings. These licenses may be terminated, or we may be unable to license third-party technologies for future offerings. In addition, we may be unable to renegotiate acceptable third-party license terms, or we may be subject to infringement liability if third-party technologies that we license is found to infringe intellectual property rights of others. Changes in or the discontinuance of third-party licenses could lead to a material increase in our costs or to our offerings becoming inoperable or their performance being materially reduced. As a result, we may need to incur additional development costs to help ensure continued performance of our offerings, and we may experience a decreased demand for our offerings.  Changes in third-party software or systems or the emergence of new industry standards could materially adversely affect the operation of and demand for our existing software  The functionalities of our software depend in part on the ability of our software to interface with our customers information technology  IT  infrastructure and cloud environments, including software applications, network infrastructure, and end user devices, which are supplied to our customers by various other vendors. When new or updated versions of these third-party software or systems are introduced, or new industry standards in related fields emerge, we may be required to develop updated versions of or enhancements to our software to help ensure that it continues to effectively interoperate with our customers IT infrastructure and cloud environments. If new or modified operating systems are introduced or new web standards and technologies or new standards in the field of database access technology emerge that are incompatible with our software, development efforts to maintain the interoperability of our software with our customers IT infrastructure and cloud environments could require substantial capital investment and employee resources. If we are unable to update our software in a timely manner, cost-effectively, or at all, the ability of our software to perform key functions could be impaired, which may impact our customers satisfaction with our software, potentially result in breach of warranty or other claims, and materially adversely affect demand for our software.  The nature of our software makes it particularly susceptible to undetected errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities, which could cause problems with how the software performs and, in turn, reduce demand for our software, reduce our revenue, and lead to litigation claims against us  Despite extensive testing by us and our current and potential customers, we have in the past discovered software errors, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in our offerings after commercial shipments began and they may be found in future offerings or releases. This could result in lost revenue, damage to our reputation, or delays in market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We may also need to expend resources and capital to correct these defects if they occur.  Our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability, warranty, and other claims. It is possible these provisions are unenforceable in certain domestic or international jurisdictions, and we may be exposed to such claims. A successful claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Our intellectual property is valuable, and any inability to protect it could reduce the value of our offerings and brand  Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our software or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, and contractual commitments can only provide limited protection. Any intellectual property owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Any of our pending or future intellectual property applications, whether or not currently being challenged, may not be issued with the scope we seek, if at all. Moreover, amendments to and  developing jurisprudence regarding U.S. and international law may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement. In addition, although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and contractors, the confidential nature of our intellectual property may not be maintained. Furthermore, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property as do the laws of the United States. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, we may not remain competitive.  Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights  We periodically receive notices from third parties claiming we are infringing their intellectual property rights. The number of such claims may increase as we expand our offerings and branding, the number of offerings and level of competition in our industry grow, the functionality of offerings overlaps, and the volume of issued patents, patent applications, and copyright and trademark registrations continues to increase. Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, could     be time-consuming, costly, and or result in litigation;    divert managements time and attention from developing our business;    require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements that we would normally find unacceptable;    require us to stop selling certain of our offerings;    require us to redesign certain of our offerings using alternative non-infringing technology or practices, which could require significant effort and expense;    require us to rename certain of our offerings or entities; or    require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers or channel partners.  Additionally, while we monitor our use of third-party software, including open source software, our processes for controlling such use in our offerings may not be effective. If we fail to comply with the terms or conditions associated with third-party software that we use, if we inadvertently embed certain types of third-party software into one or more of our offerings, or if third-party software that we license is found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could subject ourselves to infringement liability and be required to re-engineer our offerings, discontinue the sale of our offerings, or make available to certain third parties or generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.  If a successful infringement claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology or brand name, as applicable, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Risks Related to Our Operations  We face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic that could significantly disrupt or materially adversely affect our business and operating results.  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on global commercial activity and has created significant volatility in financial markets. Many governmental authorities have instituted quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, social distancing mandates, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, and closures of or operational limitations on non-essential businesses, which are adversely impacting a number of industries such as travel, leisure, hospitality, and retail. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the global economy and consumer confidence. The COVID-19 pandemic could have a sustained adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of prolonged global economic slowdown, which could decrease technology spending, adversely affect demand for our offerings, and harm our business and operating results.  Our product licenses revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods until the effects of the pandemic have subsided due to a general increase in the time it takes to close deals in the current depressed macroeconomic environment. Our product support revenues may also be negatively impacted in future periods by the overall depressed macroeconomic environment and to the extent that customers require extended payment terms or determine not to renew their product support arrangements as part of their efforts to reduce expenses. Similarly, we may experience declines in our consulting revenues in future periods due to the overall depressed macroeconomic environment and as our customers continue to operate in remote work environments and aim to reduce expenses. The uncertainty related to COVID-19 may also result in increased volatility in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements.  In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures intended to reduce the risk of the virus to our employees, customers, and communities in which we operate. We have established remote working arrangements for our employees, placed restrictions on non-essential business travel, and cancelled or shifted our customer, employee, and industry events to a virtual-only format for the foreseeable future. As a result of these precautionary measures, there could be a negative impact on our sales, marketing, and customer success efforts, continued delays in our sales cycles, delays in the release or delivery of new or enhanced offerings or unexpected changes to such offerings, or operational or other challenges, any of which could significantly disrupt our business and operating results. For example, our shift to creating virtual customer and industry events may not be successful, and we may not be able to showcase our products as effectively or generate the same customer interest, opportunities, and leads through virtual events as we have historically done through in-person events. Additionally, while we have not experienced any material disruptions to date, our technological systems or infrastructure may not be equipped to facilitate effective remote working arrangements or operate in compliance with all laws and regulations for our employees in the short or long term.  Considerable uncertainty still surrounds COVID-19 and its potential long-term economic effects and the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities and businesses. Although we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as more information and public health guidance become available, the full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and operating results will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread, severity, and potential recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, our ability to generate new business leads, impact on our customer, employee, and industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.  In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section.  Business disruptions, including interruptions, delays, or failures of our systems, third-party data center hosting facility, or other third-party services, could materially adversely affect our operating results or result in a material weakness in our internal controls that could adversely affect the market price of our stock  A significant portion of our research and development activities or certain other critical business operations are concentrated in facilities in Northern Virginia, China, and Poland. In addition, we serve our customers and manage certain critical internal processes using a third-party data center hosting facility located in the United States and other third-party services, including AWS, Azure, and other cloud services. Any disruptions or failures of our systems or the third-party hosting facility or other services that we use, including as a result of a natural disaster, fire, cyberattack, act of terrorism, geopolitical conflict, pandemic  including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , the effects of climate change, or other catastrophic event, as well as power outages, telecommunications infrastructure outages, a decision by one of our third-party service providers to close facilities that we use without adequate notice or to materially change the pricing or terms of their services, host country restrictions on the conduct of our business operations or the availability of our offerings, or other unanticipated problems with the third-party services that we use, such as a failure to meet service standards, could severely impact our ability to conduct our business operations or to attract new customers or maintain existing customers, or result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, any of which could materially adversely affect our future operating results.  Our international operations are complex and expose us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition  We receive a significant portion of our total revenues from international sales and conduct our business activities in various foreign countries, including some emerging markets where we have limited experience, where the challenges of conducting our business can be significantly different from those we have faced in more developed markets, and where business practices may create internal control risks. International revenues accounted for 41.9 , 43.7 , and 42.3  of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources and expose us to additional risks, including     fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;    new, or changes in, regulatory requirements;    tariffs, export and import restrictions, restrictions on foreign investments, tax laws, sanctions, laws and policies that favor local competitors  such as mandatory technology transfers , and other trade barriers or protection measures;    compliance with a wide variety of laws, including those relating to labor matters, antitrust, procurement and contracting, consumer and data protection, privacy, data localization, governmental access to data, network security, and encryption;    costs of localizing offerings and lack of acceptance of localized offerings;    difficulties in and costs of staffing, managing, and operating our international operations;    economic weakness or currency-related crises;    generally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;    weaker intellectual property protection;    increased risk of corporate espionage or misappropriation, theft, or misuse of intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where we have significant software development operations that have access to product source code, such as China;    our ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures;    natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or pandemics  including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic ; and    political instability and security risks in the countries where we are doing business.  Disruptions to trade, weakening of economic conditions, economic and legal uncertainties, or changes in currency rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. For example, we may face heightened risks in connection with our international operations as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The future effects of Brexit are uncertain and will depend on the implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union and any other agreements the United Kingdom may make in the future to retain access to European Union markets post their separation. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union. Brexit could also lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. In addition, the Trump administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy, including the imposition of greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, and has increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States from a number of foreign markets, following which retaliatory tariffs have been imposed on exports of certain U.S. goods to those markets. These tariffs and any further escalation of protectionist trade measures could adversely affect the markets in which we sell our offerings and, in turn, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows and it is unclear to what extent the Biden administration would undertake any of the changes proposed by the prior administration.  Changes to the U.S. taxation of our international income, or changes in foreign tax laws, could have a material effect on our future operating results. For example, the Tax Act led to corporate income tax rate changes, the modification or elimination of certain tax incentives, changes to the existing regime for taxing overseas earnings, and measures to prevent BEPS, and the United Kingdom adopted legislation imposing a tax related to offshore receipts in respect of intangible property held in low tax jurisdictions.  Moreover, compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations has exposed, and may in the future expose, us to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include anti-bribery laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, and local laws relating to procurement, contracting, and antitrust. These laws and regulations also include import and export requirements and economic and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations, and individuals. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, channel partners, and other persons with whom we do business may take actions in violation of our policies or these laws. For example, following an internal review initiated in 2018, we believe our Brazilian subsidiary failed or likely failed to comply with local procurement regulations in conducting business with certain Brazilian government entities. Any violation of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines or prohibitions on our ability to sell our offerings to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation and our brand.  These factors may have a material adverse effect on our future sales, business, operating results, and financial condition.  We face a variety of risks in doing business with U.S. and foreign federal, state, and local governments and government agencies, including risks related to the procurement process, budget constraints and cycles, termination of contracts, and compliance with government contracting requirements  Our customers include the U.S. government and a number of state and local governments and government agencies. There are a variety of risks in doing business with government entities, including   Procurement. Contracting with public sector customers is highly competitive and can be time-consuming and expensive, requiring us to incur significant up-front time and expense without any assurance that we will win a contract.  Budgetary Constraints and Cycles. Public sector funding reductions or delays adversely impact demand and payment for our offerings.  Termination of Contracts. Public sector customers often have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we may only be able to collect fees for software or services delivered prior to termination and settlement expenses. If a contract is terminated due to a default, we may not recover even those amounts, and we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer for procuring alternative software or services.  Compliance with Government Contracting Requirements. Government contractors are required to comply with a variety of complex laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, or performance of government contracts that give public sector customers substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typical for commercial contracts. These may include rights regarding price protection, the accuracy of information provided to the government, contractor compliance with socio-economic policies, and other terms unique to government contracts. Governments and government agencies routinely investigate and audit contractors for compliance with these requirements. If, as a result of an audit or review, it is determined that we have failed to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including contract termination, forfeiture of profits, fines, and suspensions or debarment from future government business and we may suffer harm to our reputation.  Our customers also include a number of foreign governments and government agencies. Similar procurement, budgetary, contract, and audit risks also apply to these entities. In addition, compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in a variety of jurisdictions can be expensive and consume significant management resources. In certain jurisdictions, our ability to win business may be constrained by political and other factors unrelated to our competitive position in the market. Each of these difficulties could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  If we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel, or if we lose the services of our Chairman of the Board of Directors   Chief Executive Officer, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, train, assimilate, and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified employees in the technology industry has historically been high, and may be further amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers, including restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract, train, assimilate, and retain other highly skilled personnel in the future. Our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of Michael J. Saylor, our Chairman of the Board of Directors   Chief Executive Officer. If we lose the services of Mr. Saylor, or if we are unable to attract, train, assimilate, and retain the highly skilled personnel we need, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the collection, processing, disclosure, storage, localization, or transmission of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with such laws and regulations, contractual obligations, or applicable privacy policies, could materially adversely affect our business  Aspects of our business involve collecting, processing, disclosing, storing, and transmitting personal data, which are subject to certain privacy policies, contractual obligations, and U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, and directives relating to privacy and data protection. We store a substantial amount of customer and employee data, including personal data, on our networks and other systems and the cloud environments we manage. In addition, the types of data subject to protection as personal data in the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere have been expanding. In recent years, the collection and use of personal data by companies have come under increased regulatory and public scrutiny, especially in relation to the collection and processing of sensitive data, such as healthcare, biometric, genetic, financial services, and childrens data, precise location data, and data regarding a persons race or ethnic origins, political opinions, or religious beliefs. For example, in the United States, protected health information is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA , which can provide for civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance. Entities  such as us  that engage in creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting protected health information provided by covered entities and other business associates are subject to enforcement under HIPAA. Our access to protected health information triggers obligations to comply with certain privacy rules and data security requirements under HIPAA.  Any systems failure or security breach that results in the release of, or unauthorized access to, personal data, or any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies, contractual obligations, or any applicable laws or regulations relating to privacy or data protection, could result in proceedings against us by domestic or foreign government entities or others, including private plaintiffs in litigation. Such proceedings could result in the imposition of sanctions, fines, penalties, liabilities, government orders, and or orders requiring that we change our data practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, and financial condition.  Various U.S. and foreign government bodies may enact new or additional laws or regulations, or issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, concerning privacy, data storage, data protection, and cross-border transfer of data that could materially adversely impact our business. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  took effect in May 2018. GDPR establishes requirements regarding the handling and security of personal data, requires disclosure of data breaches to individuals, customers, and data protection authorities in certain circumstances, requires companies to honor data subjects requests relating to their personal data, permits regulators to impose fines of up to 20,000,000 or 4  of global annual revenue, whichever is higher, and establishes  a private right of action. Furthermore, a new ePrivacy Regulation, regulating electronic communications, was proposed in 2017 and is under consideration by the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European Council. More recently, the Court of Justice of the European Union  CJEU  invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield in July 2020. The U.S.-EU Privacy Shield provided a mechanism to lawfully transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States and certain other countries. In the wake of the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield, we have transitioned to reliance on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses  SCCs  to lawfully transfer certain personal data from the European Union to the United States. The rules involving this alternative data transfer option are also undergoing revision and this transfer mechanism may also be declared invalid  or require us to change our business practices  in the future, requiring us to provide an alternative means of data transfer.  Brazil also enacted the Lei Geral de Proteo de Dados  the Brazilian General Data Protection Law , which became effective in August 2020 and imposes requirements largely similar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil. In China, we may also be subject to the Cybersecurity Law that went into effect in June 2017 and the revision of the Personal Information Security Specification that went into effect in October 2020, which have broad but uncertain application and impose a number of new privacy and data security obligations. China is also considering the implementation of new legislation on the protection of privacy and personal data, including a Personal Information Protection Law and a Data Security Law that may impose new obligations on us. Other countries are considering new or expanded laws governing privacy and data security that may impact our business practices.  The state of California has also adopted a new comprehensive privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA , which took effect in January 2020 and became enforceable in July 2020. We may be required to devote substantial resources to implement and maintain compliance with the CCPA, and noncompliance could result in regulatory investigations and fines or private litigation. Moreover, in November 2020, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act  CPRA , which amends the CCPA to create new privacy rights and obligations in California. Several other states are also considering bills similar to the CCPA or other generally applicable privacy laws that may impose additional costs and obligations on us.  Furthermore, the U.S. Congress is considering comprehensive privacy legislation. At this time, it is unclear whether Congress will pass such a law and if so, when and what it will require and prohibit. Moreover, it is not clear whether any such legislation would give the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  any new authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act in the first instance, whether Congress will grant the FTC rulemaking authority over privacy and information security, or whether Congress will vest some or all privacy and data security regulatory authority and enforcement power in a new agency, akin to EU data protection authorities.  Complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us or our customers to incur substantial costs or pay substantial fines or penalties, require us to change our business practices, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, or limit our ability to provide certain offerings in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. New laws or regulations restricting or limiting the collection or use of mobile data could also reduce demand for certain of our offerings or require changes to our business practices, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.  If we or our third-party service providers experience a disruption due to a cybersecurity attack or security breach and unauthorized parties obtain access to our customers, prospects, vendors, or channel partners data, our data, our networks or other systems, or the cloud environments we manage, our offerings may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our offerings may be reduced, our operations may be disrupted, we may incur significant legal and financial liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected  As part of our business, we process, store, and transmit our customers, prospects, vendors, and channel partners data as well as our own, including in our networks and other systems and the cloud environments we manage. Security breaches may occur due to technological error, computer viruses, or third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers or state actors, physical break-ins, industrial espionage, fraudulent inducement of employees, customers, or channel partners to disclose sensitive information such as user names or passwords, and  employee, customer, or channel partner error or malfeasance. A security breach could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our customers, prospects, vendors, or channel partners data, our data  including our proprietary information, intellectual property, or trade secrets , our networks or other systems, or the cloud environments we manage. Third parties may also conduct attacks designed to prevent access to critical data or systems through ransomware or temporarily deny customers access to our cloud environments.  We have experienced attempts by third parties to identify and exploit software and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers or service providers cloud environments, networks, and other systems. Security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented may not be effective against all current or future security threats. Because there are many different security breach techniques and such techniques continue to evolve, we may be unable to anticipate, detect, or mitigate attempted security breaches and implement adequate preventative measures.  Any security breach, ransomware attack, or successful denial of service attack could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our offerings and damage to our brand, reduce the demand for our offerings, disrupt our normal business operations, require us to spend material resources to investigate or correct the breach, require us to notify affected customers or individuals and or applicable regulators and others, provide identity theft protection services to individuals, expose us to legal liabilities, including litigation, regulatory enforcement, and indemnity obligations, and materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Our software operates in conjunction with and is dependent on third-party products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these products or components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.  These risks will increase as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud subscriptions and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of our customers, prospects, vendors, channel partners, and our own data. In particular, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in cyberattacks and other malicious activities as shelter-in-place orders and remote working conditions have led businesses to increasingly rely on virtual environments and communication systems.  Risks Related to Our Bitcoin Strategy and Holdings  Our bitcoin strategy exposes us to various risks associated with bitcoin  In September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted our Treasury Reserve Policy, under which our treasury reserve assets will consist of  i  Cash Assets held by us that exceed working capital requirements and  ii  bitcoin held by us, with bitcoin serving as the primary treasury reserve asset on an ongoing basis, subject to market conditions and anticipated needs of the business for Cash Assets.  In 2021, we determined to adopt, in addition to and in conjunction with our Treasury Reserve Policy, a business strategy of purchasing and holding bitcoin, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin.  We have only recently adopted this bitcoin acquisition strategy and are continually examining the risks and rewards of such a strategy. This strategy has not been tested over time or under various market conditions. Some investors and other market participants may disagree with this strategy or actions we undertake to implement it. If bitcoin prices fall or our bitcoin acquisition strategy otherwise proves unsuccessful, it would adversely impact the market price of our class A common stock.  As of February 8, 2021, we held approximately 71,079 bitcoins that were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of  1.145 billion and an average purchase price of approximately  16,109 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. These purchases included purchases of bitcoin using the net proceeds of our issuance of  650.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.750  Convertible Senior Notes due 2025  the notes  in the fourth quarter of 2020. As part of our overall business strategy, we expect to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods, though we may also sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate Cash Assets for treasury management purposes.  While our bitcoin is currently owned directly by us, we are investigating other potential approaches to holding our bitcoin assets. If we change the means by which we hold our bitcoin assets, the accounting treatment for our bitcoin may correspondingly change. A change in the accounting treatment of our bitcoin holdings could have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods and could increase the volatility of our reported results of operations as well as affecting the carrying value of our bitcoin on our balance sheet, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our class A common stock.  Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset that has traded below  4,000 per bitcoin and above  44,000 per bitcoin in our principal market in the 12 months preceding the date of this Annual Report. Bitcoin does not pay interest or other returns and so our ability to generate cash from our bitcoin holdings depends on sales. The impact of our bitcoin holdings on our financial results and the market price of our class A common stock is likely to increase as we increase our overall holdings of bitcoin in the future. See Risks Related to Our Bitcoin Strategy and Holdings - Our historical financial statements do not reflect the potential variability in earnings that we may experience in the future relating to bitcoin holdings.  Fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of our class A common stock  To the extent investors view the value of our class A common stock as linked to the value or change in the value of our bitcoin, fluctuations in the price of bitcoin may significantly influence the market price of our class A common stock.  Our historical financial statements do not reflect the potential variability in earnings that we may experience in the future relating to bitcoin holdings  Our historical financial statements, including those for the year ended December 31, 2020, do not fully reflect the potential variability in earnings that we may experience in the future from holding or selling significant amounts of bitcoin.  The price of bitcoin has historically been subject to dramatic price fluctuations and is highly volatile. As explained more fully in Note 2 g  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included in this Annual Report, we determine the fair value of our bitcoin based on quoted  unadjusted  prices on the active exchange that we have determined is our principal market for bitcoin. We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted  unadjusted  prices on the active exchange, indicate that it is more likely than not that any of our bitcoin assets is impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange at any time since acquiring the specific bitcoin held. If the carrying value of a bitcoin exceeds that lowest price at any time during the quarter, an impairment loss is deemed to have occurred with respect to that bitcoin in the amount equal to the difference between its carrying value and such lowest price, and subsequent increases in the price of bitcoin will not affect the carrying value of our bitcoin. Gains  if any  are not recorded until realized upon sale, at which point they would be presented net of any impairment losses. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sale price and carrying value of the specific bitcoin sold immediately prior to sale.  As a result, any decrease in the fair value of bitcoin below our carrying value for such assets at any time since their acquisition requires us to incur an impairment charge, and such charge could be material to our financial results for the applicable reporting period, which may create significant volatility in our reported earnings and decrease the carrying value of our digital assets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our class A common stock.  At December 31, 2020, we carried  1.054 billion of digital assets on our balance sheet, consisting of approximately 70,469 bitcoin and reflecting  70.7 million in cumulative impairment losses attributable to bitcoin trading price fluctuations, and held  59.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to no digital assets and  456.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, reflecting the shift in our liquid asset holdings following the adoption of our Treasury Reserve Policy. Digital asset impairment losses of  70.7 million incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 represented 17.5  of our operating expenses for the year, compared to no digital asset  impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2019, contributing to our net loss of  7.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net income of  34.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.  Because we intend to purchase additional bitcoin in future periods and increase our overall holdings of bitcoin, we expect that the proportion of our total assets represented by bitcoin holdings will increase in the future. As a result, volatility in our earnings in future periods may be significantly more than what we experienced in prior periods.  Changes in securities regulation may adversely impact the market price of our class A common stock  Although bitcoin and other digital assets have experienced a surge of investor attention since bitcoin was invented in 2008, investors in the United States currently have limited means to gain exposure to bitcoin through traditional investment channels such as 401 k  retirement accounts, and instead generally must hold bitcoin through hosted wallets provided by digital asset service providers or through unhosted wallets that expose the investor to risks associated with loss or hacking of their private keys. Given the relative novelty of digital assets, general lack of familiarity with the processes needed to hold bitcoin directly, as well as the potential reluctance of financial planners and advisers to recommend direct bitcoin holdings to their retail customers because of the manner in which such holdings are custodied, some investors have sought exposure to bitcoin through investment vehicles that hold bitcoin and issue shares representing fractional undivided interests in their underlying bitcoin holdings. Although a number of investment vehicles currently offer this exposure to bitcoin, none of these investment vehicles currently offers its shares directly to the public in the United States, and such shares are offered only to accredited investors on a private placement basis. Investors who are not eligible to participate in these private placements may nevertheless purchase shares of these investment vehicles in the over-the-counter market, where such shares have historically traded at a premium to the net asset value  NAV  of the underlying bitcoin. These premiums have at times been substantial.  One reason for the substantial premium to NAV exhibited by the trading prices of shares of some bitcoin investment vehicles may be because of the relative scarcity of traditional investment vehicles providing investment exposure to bitcoin. To the extent investors view the value of our class A common stock as providing such exposure, it is possible that the value of our class A common stock also includes a premium over the value of our bitcoin.  Another reason for the substantial premium to NAV exhibited by the trading prices of shares of some bitcoin investment vehicles is that such vehicles operate in a manner similar to closed-end investment funds as opposed to exchange-traded funds  ETFs  and therefore do not continuously offer to create and redeem their shares at NAV in exchange for bitcoin. Although several bitcoin investment vehicles have attempted to list their shares on a U.S. national securities exchange to permit them to function in the manner of an ETF with continuous share creation and redemption at NAV, to date the SEC has declined to approve any such listing, citing concerns over the surveillance of trading in markets for the underlying bitcoin as well as concerns about fraud and manipulation in bitcoin trading markets.  If the SEC were to resolve its concerns over surveillance of the bitcoin trading markets, it is possible that the SEC would permit the listing of ETFs specializing in bitcoin, allowing these funds to offer their shares directly to the public. In addition to greatly simplifying the task of gaining investment exposure to bitcoin, the listing of a bitcoin ETF with continuous share creation and redemption at NAV would be expected to eliminate the NAV premiums currently exhibited by shares of investment vehicles that trade in the over-the-counter market. To the extent that our class A common stock is viewed as an alternative-to-bitcoin investment vehicle and trades at a premium to the value of our bitcoin holdings, that premium may also be eliminated, causing the value of our class A common stock to decline.  In addition, any introduction of bitcoin ETFs on U.S. national securities exchanges may be viewed by investors as offering pure play exposure to bitcoin that would generally not be subject to federal income tax at the entity level as we are.  As a result of the foregoing factors, to the extent investors view our class A common stock as linked to the value of our bitcoin holdings, the introduction of bitcoin ETFs on U.S. national securities exchanges could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our class A common stock.  Our bitcoin holdings could subject us to regulatory scrutiny  As noted above, several bitcoin investment vehicles have attempted to list their shares on a U.S. national securities exchange to permit them to function in the manner of an ETF with continuous share creation and redemption at NAV. To date the SEC has declined to approve any such listing, citing concerns over the surveillance of trading in markets for the underlying bitcoin as well as concerns about fraud and manipulation in bitcoin trading markets. Even though we do not function in the manner of an ETF and do not offer continuous share creation and redemption at NAV, it is possible that we nevertheless could face regulatory scrutiny from the SEC, as a company with securities traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.  In addition, as digital assets, including bitcoin, have grown in popularity and market size, there has been increasing focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist activities, or entities subject to sanctions regimes. While we have implemented and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to promote compliance with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations and take care to only acquire our bitcoin through entities subject to anti money laundering regulation and related compliance rules in the United States, if we are found to have purchased any of our bitcoin from bad actors that have used bitcoin to launder money or persons subject to sanctions, we may be subject to regulatory proceedings and further transactions or dealings in bitcoin may be restricted or prohibited.  Due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of many bitcoin trading venues, they may experience fraud, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of our bitcoin  Bitcoin trading venues are relatively new and, in some cases, unregulated. Furthermore, there are many bitcoin trading venues which do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in bitcoin trading venues, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of bitcoin trading.  For example, in 2019 there were reports claiming that 80-95  of bitcoin trading volume on trading venues was false or non-economic in nature, with specific focus on unregulated exchanges located outside of the United States. Such reports may indicate that the bitcoin market is significantly smaller than expected and that the United States makes up a significantly larger percentage of the bitcoin market than is commonly understood. Nonetheless, any actual or perceived false trading in the bitcoin market, and any other fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices, could adversely affect the value of our bitcoin.  Negative perception, a lack of stability in the broader bitcoin markets and the closure or temporary shutdown of bitcoin trading venues due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may reduce confidence in bitcoin and result in greater volatility in the prices of bitcoin. To the extent investors view our class A common stock as linked to the value of our bitcoin holdings, these potential consequences of a bitcoin trading venues failure could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our class A common stock.  The price of bitcoin may be influenced by regulatory, commercial, and technical factors that are highly uncertain  Bitcoin and other digital assets are relatively novel and are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may adversely impact their price. For example, the application of securities laws and other regulations to such assets is unclear in certain respects, and it is possible that regulators in the United States or foreign countries may create new regulations or interpret laws in a manner that adversely affects the price of bitcoin. The growth of the digital assets industry in general, and the use and acceptance of bitcoin in particular, may also impact the price of bitcoin and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The pace of worldwide growth in the adoption and use of bitcoin may depend, for instance, on public familiarity with digital assets, ease of buying and accessing bitcoin, institutional demand for bitcoin as an investment asset, consumer demand for bitcoin as a means of payment, and the availability and popularity of alternatives to bitcoin. Even if growth in bitcoin adoption occurs in the near or medium-term, there is no assurance that bitcoin usage will continue to grow over the long-term. Because bitcoin has no physical existence beyond the record of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, a variety of technical factors related to the Bitcoin blockchain could also impact the price of bitcoin. For example, malicious attacks by miners who validate bitcoin transactions, inadequate mining fees to incentivize validating of bitcoin transactions, hard forks of the  Bitcoin blockchain into multiple blockchains, and advances in quantum computing could undercut the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain and negatively affect the price of bitcoin. The liquidity of bitcoin may also be reduced and damage to the public perception of bitcoin may occur, if financial institutions were to deny banking services to businesses that hold bitcoin, provide bitcoin-related services or accept bitcoin as payment, which could also decrease the price of bitcoin.  The concentration of our bitcoin holdings enhances the risks inherent in our bitcoin acquisition strategy  As of February 8, 2021, we held approximately 71,079 bitcoins that were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of  1.145 billion and we intend to purchase additional bitcoin and increase our overall holdings of bitcoin in the future. The concentration of our bitcoin holdings limits the risk mitigation that we could take advantage of by purchasing a more diversified portfolio of treasury assets, and the absence of diversification enhances the risks inherent in our bitcoin acquisition strategy. If there is a significant decrease in the price of bitcoin, we will experience a more pronounced impact on our financial condition than if we used our cash to purchase a more diverse portfolio of assets.  Our bitcoin holdings are less liquid than our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents  In September 2020, we adopted bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. Historically, the bitcoin markets have been characterized by more price volatility, less liquidity, and lower trading volumes compared to sovereign currencies markets, as well as relative anonymity, a developing regulatory landscape, susceptibility to market abuse and manipulation, and various other risks inherent in its entirely electronic, virtual form and decentralized network. During times of market instability, we may not be able to sell our bitcoin at reasonable prices or at all. As a result, our bitcoin holdings may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. If we are unable to sell our bitcoin, or if we are forced to sell our bitcoin at a significant loss, in order to meet our working capital requirements, our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted.  If we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach or cyberattack and unauthorized parties obtain access to our bitcoin, we may lose some or all of our bitcoin and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected  Security breaches and cyberattacks are of particular concern with respect to our bitcoin. Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities. A successful security breach or cyberattack could result in a partial or total loss of our bitcoin in a manner that may not be covered by insurance or indemnity provisions of the custody agreement with a custodian who holds our bitcoin. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The loss or destruction of a private key required to access our bitcoin may be irreversible. If we are unable to access our private keys or if we experience a cyberattack or other data loss relating to our bitcoin, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Bitcoin is controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet in which the bitcoin is held. While the Bitcoin blockchain ledger requires a public key relating to a digital wallet to be published when used in a transaction, private keys must be safeguarded and kept private in order to prevent a third party from accessing the bitcoin held in such wallet. To the extent our private key is lost, destroyed, or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, we will be unable to access the bitcoin held in the related digital wallet. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that our digital wallets will not be compromised as a result of a cyberattack. The bitcoin and blockchain ledger, as well as other cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies, have been, and may in the future be, subject to security breaches, cyberattacks, or other malicious activities.  In light of the significant amount of bitcoin we hold, we are continuing to seek a greater degree of diversification in the use of custodial services as the extent of potential risk of loss is dependent, in part, on the degree of diversification. As of December 31, 2020, the insurance that covers losses of our bitcoin holdings is only a small  fraction of the entirety of our holdings, and there can be no guarantee that such insurance will be maintained as part of the custodial services we have or that such coverage will cover losses with respect to our bitcoin.  Regulatory change reclassifying bitcoin as a security could lead to our classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and could adversely affect the market price of bitcoin and the market price of our class A common stock.  While senior SEC officials have stated their view that bitcoin is not a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the SEC has so far refused to permit the listing of any bitcoin-based exchange traded funds, citing, among other things, concerns regarding bitcoin market integrity and custodial protections. It is possible that the SEC could take a contrary position to the one taken by its senior officials or a federal court could conclude that bitcoin is a security. Such a determination could lead to our classification as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which would subject us to significant additional regulatory controls that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations and also may require us to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our business.  In addition, if bitcoin is determined to constitute a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the additional regulatory restrictions imposed by those laws could adversely affect the market price of bitcoin and in turn adversely affect the market price of our class A common stock.  Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock  The market price of our class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile  The market price of our class A common stock has historically been volatile and this volatility has been significant in recent periods. Since August 11, 2020, the date on which we announced our initial purchase of bitcoin, the closing price of our class A common stock has increased from  123.62 as of August 10, 2020, the last trading day before our announcement, to  1,272.94 as of February 9, 2021. The market price of our class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to     quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;    announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the likelihood of which may be enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance relating to our anticipated financial performance in future periods;    announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, dispositions, new offerings, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;    fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, in which we have significant holdings, and expect we will continue to make, significant purchases, and announcements about our transactions in bitcoin;    our ability to develop, market, and deliver new and enhanced offerings on a timely basis;    commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;    recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates and our ability to meet those estimates;    investor perception of our Company;    announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations;    the volume of shares of our class A common stock available for public sale;    sales or purchases of stock by us or by our stockholders and issuances of awards under our stock incentive plan; and    general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, the stock market and the market for technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies in those markets. These market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.  Because of the rights of our two classes of common stock and because we are controlled by Michael J. Saylor, who beneficially owns the majority of our class B common stock, Mr. Saylor could transfer control of MicroStrategy to a third party without the approval of our Board of Directors or our other stockholders, prevent a third party from acquiring us, or limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters  We have two classes of common stock  class A common stock and class B common stock. Holders of our class A common stock generally have the same rights as holders of our class B common stock, except that holders of class A common stock have one vote per share while holders of class B common stock have ten votes per share. As of February 2, 2021, holders of our class B common stock owned 1,964,025 shares of class B common stock, or 72.0  of the total voting power. As of February 2, 2021, Mr. Saylor, our Chairman of the Board of Directors   Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 1,961,668 shares of class B common stock, or 72.0  of the total voting power. Accordingly, Mr. Saylor can control MicroStrategy through his ability to determine the outcome of elections of our directors, amend our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and take other actions requiring the vote or consent of stockholders, including mergers, going-private transactions, and other extraordinary transactions and their terms.  Our certificate of incorporation allows holders of class B common stock to transfer shares of class B common stock, subject to the approval of stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding class B common stock. Mr. Saylor could, without the approval of our Board of Directors or our other stockholders, transfer voting control of MicroStrategy to a third party. Such a transfer of control could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Mr. Saylor could also prevent a change of control of MicroStrategy, regardless of whether holders of class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. In addition, this concentrated control limits stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our non-controlling stockholders do not view as beneficial or that conflict with their interests. As a result, the market price of our class A common stock could be materially adversely affected.  Our status as a controlled company could make our class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise materially adversely affect our stock price  Because we qualify as a controlled company under Nasdaq corporate governance rules, we are not required to have independent directors comprise a majority of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our Board of Directors is not required to have an independent compensation or nominating committee or to have the independent directors exercise the nominating function. We are also not required to have the compensation of our executive officers be determined by a compensation committee of independent directors. In addition, we are not required to empower our Compensation Committee with the authority to engage the services of any compensation consultants, legal counsel, or other advisors, or to have the Compensation Committee assess the independence of compensation consultants, legal counsel, and other advisors that it engages.  In light of our status as a controlled company, our Board of Directors has determined not to establish an independent nominating committee or have its independent directors exercise the nominating function and has elected instead to have the Board of Directors be directly responsible for nominating members of the Board. A majority of our Board of Directors is currently comprised of independent directors, and our Board of Directors has established a Compensation Committee comprised entirely of independent directors. The Compensation Committee determines the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer. However, our Board of Directors has authorized our Chief Executive Officer to determine the compensation of executive officers other than himself, rather than having such compensation determined by the Compensation Committee, except that certain performance-based executive officer compensation is determined by the Compensation Committee. Awards made to directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan  as amended, the 2013 Equity Plan  are also approved by the Compensation Committee. Additionally, while our Compensation Committee is empowered with  the authority to retain and terminate outside counsel, compensation consultants, and other experts or consultants, it is not required to assess their independence.  Although currently a majority of our Board of Directors is comprised of independent directors and the Compensation Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors, we may elect in the future not to have independent directors constitute a majority of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, our Chief Executive Officers compensation determined by a compensation committee of independent directors, or a compensation committee of the Board of Directors at all.  Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections that are afforded to stockholders of companies that are required to follow all of the Nasdaq corporate governance rules. Our status as a controlled company could make our class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise materially adversely affect our stock price.  Future sales, or the perception of future sales, of our class A common stock, convertible debt instruments or other convertible securities could depress the price of our class A common stock.  We may issue and sell additional shares of class A common stock, convertible notes, or other securities in subsequent offerings to raise capital or issue shares for other purposes, including in connection with the acquisition of additional bitcoin. We cannot predict     the size of future issuances of equity securities,    the size and terms of future issuances of convertible debt instruments or other convertible securities    the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of the class A common stock.  Transactions involving newly issued class A common stock or other convertible debt instruments or other convertible securities could result in dilution, possibly substantial, to holders of our class A common stock.  Risks Relating to Our Outstanding Convertible Notes and Potential Future Indebtedness  We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the notes in cash or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes  Holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in the indenture governing the notes  the indenture . In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect  or have previously irrevocably elected  to deliver solely shares of our class A common stock to settle such conversion  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted as described in the indenture. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.  The conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results  In the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our class A common stock  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness  As of the date of this Annual Report, there are outstanding  650 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes. In addition, our bitcoin acquisition strategy anticipates that we may issue additional debt in future periods to finance additional purchases of bitcoin. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes or any subsequently issued indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling bitcoin or other assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.  The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash and or shares, such as the notes, could have a material effect on our diluted earnings per share  In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  published Accounting Standards Update 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options  Subtopic 470-20  and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity  Subtopic 815-40 , Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity  ASU 2020-06 . These amendments are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We intend to early adopt the amendments effective January 1, 2021. As a result of this early adoption, the notes will be subject to the if-converted method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share will be calculated assuming that all of the notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive, which may adversely affect our diluted earnings per share. Refer to Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail on the impact of adopting ASU 2020-06 on diluted earnings per share."}

Business Overview   MicroStrategy pursues two corporate strategies in the operation of its business. One strategy is to grow our enterprise analytics software business and the other strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin.  We are a global leader in enterprise analytics software and services. Our vision is to enable Intelligence Everywhere. The MicroStrategy platform brings together data from our customers enterprise applications, such as their financial systems, human resources systems, and supply chain and customer relationship management tools, to provide analytics for actionable insights. Customers can also use our consulting and education offerings to harness MicroStrategys innovative technology and empower their workforce to make better decisions.  Our customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries, including retail, consulting, technology, manufacturing, banking, insurance, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, as well as the public sector.  The analytics market is highly competitive. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate our offerings from those offered by large software vendors that provide products across multiple lines of business, including one or more products that directly compete with our offerings, and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes. We believe a key differentiator of MicroStrategy is our modern, open, comprehensive enterprise platform that can be extended to other tools and systems, can scale across the enterprise, is optimized for cloud or on-premises deployments, and can be combined with unique packages of our expert services and education offerings.  In 2021, we determined also to pursue as part of our overall business strategy, a strategy of investing our liquid assets that exceed working capital requirements in bitcoin, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. We believe that our bitcoin strategy is complementary to our analytics software and services business, as we believe that our bitcoin and related activities in support of the bitcoin network enhance awareness of our brand and can provide opportunities to secure new customers for our analytics offerings. We are also exploring opportunities to apply bitcoin related technologies such as blockchain analytics into our software offerings. We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes. As of February 8, 2021, the Company holds approximately 71,079 bitcoin that were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of  1.145 billion and an average purchase price of approximately  16,109 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.  Impact of COVID-19 on Our Software Strategy  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant economic disruption. It has already disrupted global travel and supply chains and adversely impacted global commercial activity. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds COVID-19 and its potential long-term economic effects, as well as the effectiveness of any responses taken by government authorities and businesses. The travel restrictions, limits on hours of operations and or closures of non-essential businesses, and other efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 have significantly disrupted business activity globally.  Significant uncertainty exists concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and prospects business and operations in future periods. Although our product licenses revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe our product licenses revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods until the effects of the pandemic have subsided due to a general increase in the time it takes to close deals in the current depressed macroeconomic environment. Although we continued to see high renewal rates in our product support services during the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe our product support revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods by the overall depressed macroeconomic environment and to the extent that customers require extended payment terms or determine not to renew their product support arrangements as part of their efforts to reduce expenses. Similarly, we may experience declines in our consulting revenues in future periods due to the overall depressed macroeconomic environment and as our customers continue to operate in remote work environments and aim to reduce expenses. The uncertainty related to COVID-19 may also result in increased volatility in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements.  We are also continuing to adapt our operations to meet the challenges of this uncertain and rapidly evolving situation, including establishing remote working arrangements for our employees, limiting non-essential business travel, and cancelling or shifting our customer, employee, and industry events to a virtual-only format for the foreseeable future. Our sales and marketing expenses decreased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2020, as we adapted to the challenges of selling in the current depressed macroeconomic environment, adopted virtual sales and marketing practices, and streamlined our team to sell in this new environment.  We have received, and may continue to receive, government assistance from various relief packages available in countries where we operate. For example, in the United States, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act  the CARES Act  was enacted on March 27, 2020 to provide broad-based economic relief to various sectors of the U.S. economy through a variety of means, including payroll and income tax deferrals and employee retention credits. In the Asia Pacific region, government assistance provided to us has primarily been in the form of employer payroll tax exemptions. We have deferred payment of  4.6 million of our employer portion of U.S. social security taxes accrued through December 31, 2020, half of which we expect to pay by December 31, 2021 and the remainder by December 31, 2022. Where taxes payable to government entities have been deferred to a later date, no reduction of expenses has been recorded.  Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that may negatively impact our business in future periods include, but are not limited to  limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their business, purchase our products and services, and make timely payments; curtailed consumer spending; deferred purchasing decisions; delayed consulting services implementations; and decreases in product licenses revenues driven by channel partners. We will continue to actively monitor the nature and extent of the impact to our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Treasury Reserve Policy and Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy  In September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Treasury Reserve Policy  as amended to date, the Treasury Reserve Policy  that updated our treasury management and capital allocation strategies, under which our treasury reserve assets will consist of     cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments  Cash Assets  held by us that exceed working capital requirements; and    bitcoin held by us, with bitcoin serving as the primary treasury reserve asset on an ongoing basis, subject to market conditions and anticipated needs of the business for Cash Assets.  As part of these treasury management and capital allocation strategies, we purchased a total of approximately 70,469 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  1.125 billion in 2020 for an average purchase price of approximately  15,964 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. These purchases included purchases of bitcoin using the net proceeds of issuance of  650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750  Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 in the fourth quarter of 2020.  At December 31, 2020, we carried  1.054 billion of digital assets on our balance sheet, consisting of the approximately 70,469 bitcoins and reflecting  70.7 million in cumulative impairment losses attributable to bitcoin trading price fluctuations, and held  59.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to no digital assets and  456.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, reflecting the shift in our liquid asset holdings following the adoption of our new Treasury Reserve Policy. Digital asset impairment losses of  70.7 million incurred in 2020 represented 17.5  of our operating expenses for the year, compared to no digital asset impairment losses for 2019, contributing to our net loss of  7.5 million for 2020 compared to net income of  34.4 million in 2019.  In 2021, we determined to adopt, in addition to and in conjunction with our Treasury Reserve Policy, a business strategy of purchasing bitcoin, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoins in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes.  As of February 8, 2021, we held approximately 71,079 bitcoins that were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of  1.145 billion and an average purchase price of approximately  16,109 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses.  Operating Highlights  The following table sets forth certain operating highlights  in thousands  for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019   Years Ended December 31,  Revenues  Product licenses     86,743     87,471  Subscription services  33,082  29,394  Total product licenses and subscription services  119,825  116,865  Product support  284,434  292,035  Other services  76,476  77,427  Total revenues  480,735  486,327  Cost of revenues  Product licenses  2,293  2,131  Subscription services  14,833  15,161  Total product licenses and subscription services  17,126  17,292  Product support  23,977  28,317  Other services  49,952  54,365  Total cost of revenues  91,055  99,974  Gross profit  389,680  386,353  Operating expenses  Sales and marketing  148,910  191,235  Research and development  103,561  109,423  General and administrative  80,136  86,697  Digital asset impairment losses  70,698  Total operating expenses  403,305  387,355  Loss from operations      13,625         1,002     We base our internal operating expense forecasts on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in our operating results. In addition, we have incurred and may continue to incur significant impairment losses on our digital assets and we may recognize gains upon sale of our digital assets in the future, which would be presented net of any impairment losses within operating expenses. We therefore believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.  Share-based Compensation Expense  As discussed in Note 12, Share-based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our class A common stock, restricted stock units, and certain other stock-based awards under our 2013 Equity Plan. Share-based compensation expense  in thousands  from these awards was recognized in the following cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,  Cost of subscription services revenues        Cost of product support revenues  Cost of consulting revenues  Cost of education revenues  Sales and marketing  1,609  1,943  Research and development  2,740  2,460  General and administrative  6,349  5,250  Total share-based compensation expense     11,153     10,209  As of December 31, 2020, we estimated that approximately  36.6 million of additional share-based compensation expense for awards granted under the 2013 Equity Plan will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 3.1 years.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  We are providing supplemental financial measures for  i  non-GAAP income from operations that excludes the impact of our share-based compensation expense and impairment losses and gains on sale from intangible assets, which include our digital assets,  ii  non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact of our share-based compensation expense, impairment losses and gains on sale from intangible assets, which include our digital assets and the Domain Name Sale in the second quarter of 2019, interest expense arising from the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs on our convertible senior notes, and related income tax effects, and  iii  certain non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses that exclude foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States  GAAP  and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes  i  a significant non-cash expense that we believe is not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment and the resulting share-based compensation expense could vary significantly in comparison to other companies and  ii  significant impairment losses and gains on sale from intangible assets, which include our bitcoin. The second set of supplemental financial measures excludes the impact of  i  share-based compensation expense,  ii  impairment losses and gains on sale from intangible assets, which include our bitcoin and the Domain Name Sale, which was outside of our normal business operations,  iii  non-cash interest expense arising from the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes, and  iv  related income tax effects. Although the portion of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount will be eliminated upon our planned adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021, excluding the current year non-cash interest expense related to both the amortization of the debt discount and the issuance costs will allow for greater comparability of our results after we adopt the new accounting rules. The third set of supplemental financial measures excludes changes resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates so that results may be compared to the same period in the prior year on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures can also facilitate comparison of our operating results to those of our competitors.  Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Similarly, we expect that the portion of interest expense arising from the amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be a recurring expense over the term of the convertible senior notes, even after our planned adoption of ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2021. We have also excluded impairment losses and gains on sale from intangible assets from the first two non-GAAP financial measures, either of which may occur in future periods as a result of our continued holdings of significant amounts of bitcoin. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.

It shows the increase  decrease  in material international revenues or expenses, as applicable, from the same period in the prior year, based on comparisons to the prior year quarterly average foreign currency exchange rates. The term international refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada.   2   The Non-GAAP Constant Currency reflects the current period GAAP amount, less the Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Impact.   3   The Non-GAAP Constant Currency   Change reflects the percentage change between the current period Non-GAAP Constant Currency amount and the GAAP amount for the same period in the prior year.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and equity, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates, particularly estimates relating to our convertible senior notes and revenue recognition, have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.  Convertible Debt Arrangement  As discussed in Note 9, Convertible Senior Notes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we issued convertible senior notes in December 2020. As the notes contain conversion features, we must separate the debt and equity components of the notes. The carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument without any associated conversion features at the time of issuance and the carrying amount of the equity component is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds of the notes. We also allocate issuance costs associated with the offering between debt and equity based on their relative carrying values at the time of issuance. Such issuance costs are taken as a direct reduction to the debt and equity components. Both the difference between the principal and the liability components initial carrying value and the issuance costs allocated to the debt component are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the expected term of the notes.  In determining the fair value of a similar debt instrument without any associated conversion features, we estimated a nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance using a blend of different methodologies, which considered Level 2 inputs such as observable market prices of our debt and class A common stock, our historical and implied class A common stock volatility, a synthetic credit rating consistent with that utilized for determining the incremental borrowing rate for our accounting of leasing arrangements, and analysis of similar convertible debt issuances and their equivalent nonconvertible debt yields.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue using a five-step model    i   Identifying the contract s  with a customer,   ii   Identifying the performance obligation s ,   iii   Determining the transaction price,   iv   Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and   v   Recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.  We have elected to exclude taxes assessed by government authorities in determining the transaction price, and therefore revenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers.  Performance Obligations and Timing of Revenue Recognition  We primarily sell goods and services that fall into the categories discussed below. Each category contains one or more performance obligations that are either  i  capable of being distinct  i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with readily available resources, including those purchased separately from us  and distinct within the context of the contract  i.e., separately identifiable from other promises in the contract  or  ii  a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Aside from our term and perpetual product licenses, which are delivered at a point in time, the majority of our services are delivered over time.  Product Licenses  We sell different types of business intelligence software, licensed on a term or perpetual basis and installed either on premises or on a public cloud that is procured and managed by the customer. Although product licenses are sold with product support, the software is fully functional at the outset of the arrangement and is considered a distinct performance obligation. Revenue from product license sales is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the customer, which is the later of delivery or commencement of the license term. We may also sell through resellers and OEMs who purchase our software for resale. In reseller arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the end user. In OEM arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the OEM.  Subscription Services  We also sell access to our software through MCE, a cloud subscription service, wherein customers access the software through a cloud environment that we manage on behalf of the customer. Control of the software itself does not transfer to the customer under this arrangement and is not considered a separate performance obligation. Cloud subscriptions are regularly sold on a standalone basis and include technical support, monitoring, backups, updates, and quarterly service reviews. Revenue related to cloud subscriptions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to the software.  Product Support  In all product license transactions, customers are required to purchase a standard product support package and may also purchase a premium product support package for a fixed annual fee. All product support packages include both technical support and when-and-if-available software upgrades, which are treated as a single performance obligation as they are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress. Revenue from product support is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to product support.  Consulting Services  We sell consulting services to help customers plan and execute deployment of our software. Customers are not required to use consulting services to fully benefit from the software. Consulting services are regularly sold on a standalone basis and either  i  prepaid upfront or  ii  sold on a time and materials basis. Consulting arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize  or are not modified or customized by  each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customers ability to use the other consulting services or our other offerings. Revenue under consulting arrangements is recognized over time as services are delivered. For time and materials-based consulting arrangements, we have elected the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing since the invoiced amount corresponds directly to the value of our service to date.  Education Services  We sell various education and training services to our customers. Education services are sold on a standalone basis under two different types of arrangements   i  annual subscriptions to live and on-demand training courses and  ii  custom courses purchased on an hourly basis. Education arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize  or are not modified or customized by  each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customers ability to use the other education services or our other offerings. Revenue on annual subscriptions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to the training courses. Revenue on custom courses are recognized on a time and materials basis as the services are delivered.  See Note 16, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total revenues by geographic region.  Estimates and Judgments  We make estimates and judgments to allocate the transaction price based on an observable or estimated standalone selling price  SSP . We also make estimates and judgements with respect to capitalizing incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and determining the subsequent amortization period. These estimates and judgments are discussed further below.  Determining the Transaction Price  The transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The amount of variable consideration excluded from the transaction price was not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our estimates of variable consideration are also subject to subsequent true-up adjustments and may result in changes to our transaction prices. Such true-up adjustments have not been and are not expected to be material. We have the following sources of variable consideration    i   Performance penalties - Subscription services and product support arrangements generally contain performance response time guarantees. For subscription services arrangements, we estimate variable consideration using a portfolio approach because performance penalties are tied to standard up-time requirements. For product support arrangements, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such arrangements are customer-specific. For both subscription services and product support arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate variable consideration based on historical business practices and current and future performance expectations to determine the likelihood of incurring penalties.   ii   Extended payment terms - Our standard payment terms are generally within 180 days of invoicing. If extended payment terms are granted to customers, those terms generally do not exceed one year. For contracts with extended payment terms, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such estimates are customer-specific, and we use an expected value approach to analyze historical business experience on a customer-by-customer basis to determine the likelihood that extended payment terms lead to an implied price concession.   iii   Sales and usage-based royalties - Certain product license arrangements include sales or usage-based royalties, covering both product license and product support. In these arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate and recognize revenue for royalty sales each period, utilizing historical data on a contract-by-contract basis. True-up adjustments are recorded in subsequent periods when royalty reporting is received from the OEMs.  We provide a standard software assurance warranty to repair, replace, or refund software that does not perform in accordance with documentation. The standard software assurance warranty period is generally less than one year. Assurance warranty claims were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  We do not adjust the transaction price for significant financing components where the time period between cash payment and performance is one year or less. However, there are circumstances where the timing between cash payment and performance may exceed one year. These circumstances generally involve prepaid multi-year product support and subscription services arrangements where the customer determines when the service is utilized  e.g., when to request on-call support services or when to use and access the software in the cloud . In these circumstances, we have determined no significant financing component exists because the customer controls when to utilize the service and because there are significant business purposes behind the timing difference between payment and performance  e.g., maximizing profit in the case of product support services and ensuring collectability in the case of subscription services .  Allocating the Transaction Price Based on Standalone Selling Prices  SSP   We allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in a contract based on its relative SSP. The SSP is the price, or estimated price, of the software or service when sold on a standalone basis at contract inception. In circumstances where SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP using the following methodologies    i   Product licenses - Product licenses are not sold on a standalone basis and pricing is highly variable. We establish SSP of product licenses using a residual approach after first establishing the SSP of standard product support. Standard product support is sold on a standalone basis within a narrow range of the stated net license fee, and because an economic relationship exists between product licenses and standard product support, we have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of product licenses sold on both a perpetual and term basis is a fair allocation of the transaction price.   ii   Subscription services - Given the highly variable selling price of subscription services, we establish the SSP of our subscription services arrangements using a similar residual approach after first establishing the SSP of consulting and education services to the extent they are included in the arrangement. We have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of our subscription services is a fair allocation of the transaction price.   iii   Standard product support - We establish SSP of standard product support as a percentage of the stated net license fee, given such pricing is consistent with our normal pricing practices and there exists sufficient history of customers renewing standard product support on a standalone basis at similar percentages. Semi-annually, we track renewal rates negotiated when standard product support is initially sold with a perpetual license in order to determine the SSP of standard product support within each geographic region for the upcoming quarter. If the stated standard product support fee falls within the SSP range, the specific rate in the contract will be used to determine SSP. If the stated fee is above or below SSP, the highest or lowest end of the range, respectively, will generally be used to determine SSP of standard product support for perpetual licenses. For term licenses, we determine SSP of standard product support at the lower end of the SSP range used for perpetual licenses because the term licenses are time bound, resulting in a lower value placed on product support as compared to a perpetual license.   iv   Premium product support, consulting services, and education services - SSP of premium product support, consulting services, and education services is established by using a bell-shaped curve approach to define a narrow range within each geographic region in which the services are discounted off of the list price on a standalone basis.  We often provide options to purchase future offerings at a discount. We analyze the option price against the previously established SSP of the goods or services to determine if the options represent material rights that should be accounted for as separate performance obligations. In general, an option sold at or above SSP is not considered a material right because the customer could have received that right without entering into the contract. If a material right exists, revenue associated with the option is deferred and recognized when the future goods or services are transferred, or when the option expires. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, separate performance obligations arising from future purchase options have not been material.  Incremental Costs to Obtain Customer Contracts  Incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers include certain variable compensation  e.g., commissions and bonuses  paid to our sales team. Although we may bundle our goods and services into one contract, commissions are individually determined on each distinct good or service in the contract. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on consulting and education services, which are generally performed within a one-year period and primarily sold on a standalone basis. We also expense as incurred those amounts earned on product license sales, since the amount is earned when the license is delivered. We capitalize those amounts earned on initial-year product support and cloud subscriptions and amortize the costs over a period of time that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer, which we have determined to be a period of three years. Although we typically sell product support and cloud subscriptions for a period of one year, a majority of customers renew their product support and cloud subscription arrangements. Three years is generally the period after which platforms are no longer supported by our support team and when customers generally choose to upgrade their software platform. We do not currently pay variable compensation on product support or cloud subscription renewals.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019  Revenues  Except as otherwise indicated herein, the term domestic refers to operations in the United States and Canada and the term international refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, product licenses transactions with more than  0.5 million in recognized revenue represented 43.5  and 28.7 , respectively, of our product licenses revenues. During 2020, our top three product licenses transactions totaled  15.3 million in recognized revenue, or 17.6  of total product licenses revenues, compared to  5.4 million, or 6.2  of total product licenses revenues, during 2019. Although our product licenses revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe our product licenses revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods until the effects of the pandemic have subsided due to a general increase in the time it takes to close deals in the current depressed macroeconomic environment.  Domestic product licenses revenues. Domestic product licenses revenues increased  5.7 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the average deal size and the number of transactions with more than  1.0 million in recognized revenue, partially offset by a decrease in the average deal size and the number of transactions with less than  0.5 million in recognized revenue.  International product licenses revenues. International product licenses revenues decreased  6.4 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the average deal size of transactions with less than  0.5 million in recognized revenue and a  1.2 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, partially offset by an increase in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between  0.5 million and  1.0 million.  Subscription services revenues. Subscription services revenues are derived from MCE, a cloud subscription service, that are recognized ratably over the service period in the contract. Subscription services revenues increased  3.7 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the use of subscription services by existing customers and conversions to cloud-based subscriptions from existing on-premises customers.  Product support revenues. The following table sets forth product support revenues  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Product Support Revenues   Domestic     167,266     172,124  -2.8     International  117,168  119,911  -2.3     Total product support revenues     284,434     292,035  -2.6     Product support revenues are derived from providing technical software support and software updates and upgrades to customers. Product support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Product support revenues decreased  7.6 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to certain customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term product licenses offerings and a decrease in new product support contracts. Although our product support revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe our product support revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods by the overall depressed macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to the extent that customers require extended payment terms or determine not to renew their product support arrangements as part of their efforts to reduce expenses.  Other services revenues. The following table sets forth other services revenues  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Other Services Revenues   Consulting  Domestic     33,021     29,779  10.9     International  38,324  39,880  -3.9     Total consulting revenues  71,345  69,659  2.4     Education  5,131  7,768  -33.9     Total other services revenues     76,476     77,427  -1.2     Consulting revenues. Consulting revenues are derived from helping customers plan and execute the deployment of our software. Consulting revenues increased  1.7 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in billable hours worldwide, partially offset by a decrease in average bill rates and a decrease in billable travel and entertainment expenditures. Although our consulting revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, we believe our consulting revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods by the overall depressed macroeconomic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and as our customers continue to operate in remote work environments and aim to reduce expenses.  Education revenues. Education revenues are derived from the education and training that we provide to our customers to enhance their ability to fully utilize the features and functionality of our software. These offerings include self-tutorials, custom course development, joint training with customers internal staff, and standard course offerings, with pricing dependent on the specific offering delivered. Education revenues decreased  2.6 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in the average sales price of our education offerings and education offerings that we made available at no charge for a limited time period during the first half of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Costs and Expenses  Cost of revenues. The following table sets forth cost of revenues  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Cost of Revenues   Product licenses and subscription services   Product licenses     2,293     2,131  7.6     Subscription services  14,833  15,161  -2.2     Total product licenses and subscription services  17,126  17,292  -1.0     Product support  23,977  28,317  -15.3     Other services   Consulting  42,923  47,664  -9.9     Education  7,029  6,701  4.9     Total other services  49,952  54,365  -8.1     Total cost of revenues     91,055     99,974  -8.9     Cost of product licenses revenues.

Cost of product licenses revenues did not materially change during 2020, as compared to the prior year.  Cost of subscription services revenues. Cost of subscription services revenues consists of equipment, facility and other related support costs, and personnel and related overhead costs. Subscription services headcount decreased 29.0  to 49 at December 31, 2020 from 69 at December 31, 2019. Cost of subscription services revenues did not materially change during 2020, as compared to the prior year.  Cost of product support revenues. Cost of product support revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs, including those under our Enterprise Support program. Our Enterprise Support program utilizes primarily consulting personnel to provide product support to our customers at our discretion. Compensation related to personnel providing Enterprise Support services is reported as cost of product support revenues. Product support headcount decreased 29.7  to 154 at December 31, 2020 from 219 at December 31, 2019. Cost of product support revenues decreased  4.3 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a  3.8 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to a decrease in product support staffing levels, a  0.7 million decrease in facility and other related support costs, and a  0.4 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures, partially offset by a  1.1 million increase in compensation and related costs attributable to non-product support personnel providing increased Enterprise Support services.  Cost of consulting revenues. Cost of consulting revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs, excluding those under our Enterprise Support program which are allocated to cost of product support revenues. Consulting headcount increased 0.3  to 393 at December 31, 2020 from 392 at December 31, 2019. Cost of consulting revenues decreased  4.7 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a  5.1 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures as a result of restrictions placed on non-essential business travel during the COVID-19 pandemic and a  0.9 million decrease in compensation and related costs attributable to consulting personnel providing increased Enterprise Support services, partially offset by a  1.1 million increase in compensation and related costs due to an increase in average staffing levels and a  0.7 million increase in subcontractor costs.  Cost of education revenues. Cost of education revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Education headcount decreased 2.6  to 37 at December 31, 2020 from 38 at December 31, 2019. Cost of education revenues did not materially change during 2020, as compared to the prior year.  Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs  excluding those under our Enterprise Support program which are allocated to cost of product support revenues , commissions, office facilities, travel, advertising, public relations programs, and promotional events, such as trade shows, seminars, and technical conferences. Sales and marketing headcount decreased 19.8  to 479 at December 31, 2020 from 597 at December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth sales and marketing expenses  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Sales and marketing expenses     148,910     191,235  -22.1     Sales and marketing expenses decreased  42.3 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a  10.2 million decrease in variable compensation, which includes the cancellation of a sales employee awards event as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a  9.9 million decrease in employee salaries due to a decrease in staffing levels, an  8.7 million decrease in marketing and advertising costs as we transitioned from in-person to virtual marketing events, an  8.0 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures as a result of restrictions placed on non-essential business travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, a  2.7 million decrease in facility and other related support costs, a  1.4 million decrease in subcontractor costs, a  1.0 million decrease in recruiting costs, and a  0.5 million decrease in compensation and related costs attributable to sales and marketing personnel providing increased Enterprise Support services. Included in sales and marketing expenses for 2020 is an aggregate  2.2 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact.  Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist of the personnel costs for our software engineering personnel, depreciation of equipment, and other related costs. Research and development headcount decreased 13.6  to 642 at December 31, 2020 from 743 at December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes research and development expenses  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Research and development expenses     103,561     109,423  -5.4     Research and development expenses decreased  5.9 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a  2.4 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to a decrease in staffing levels and certain COVID-19-related employer payroll tax exemptions in the Asia Pacific region, a  1.4 million decrease in recruiting costs, a  1.1 million decrease in facility and other related support costs  which includes an allocated portion of the gain on partial lease termination of our corporate headquarters lease during the fourth quarter of 2020 , a  0.7 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures as a result of restrictions placed on non-essential business travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, a  0.7 million decrease in consulting and advisory costs, and a  0.5 million decrease in employee relations expenses, partially offset by a  0.7 million increase in technology infrastructure costs.  General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, and other costs of our executive, finance, human resources, information systems, and administrative departments, as well as third-party consulting, legal, and other professional fees. General and administrative headcount decreased 28.1  to 243 at December 31, 2020 from 338 at December 31, 2019. The following table sets forth general and administrative expenses  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  General and administrative expenses     80,136     86,697  -7.6     General and administrative expenses decreased  6.6 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a  2.0 million decrease in bad debt expense, a  1.9 million decrease in facility and other related support costs  which includes an allocated portion of the gain on partial lease termination of our corporate headquarters lease during the fourth quarter of 2020 , a  1.7 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures as a result of restrictions placed on non-essential business travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, a  1.6 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to a decrease in staffing levels, a  1.0 million decrease in recruiting costs, a  0.9 million decrease in costs related to our corporate aircraft, and a  0.5 million decrease in employee relations expenses, partially offset by a  2.1 million increase in legal, consulting, and other advisory costs and a  1.1 million net increase in share-based compensation expense. The  1.1 million net increase in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan, partially offset by certain awards becoming fully vested and the forfeiture of certain stock options.  Digital asset impairment losses. Digital asset impairment losses are recognized when the carrying value of our digital assets exceeds their lowest fair value at any time since their acquisition. Impaired digital assets are written down to fair value at the time of impairment, and such impairment loss cannot be recovered for any subsequent increases in fair value. The following table sets forth digital asset impairment losses  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Digital asset impairment losses     70,698     n a  We did not sell any of our digital assets during the year ended December 31, 2020.  Other  Expense  Income, Net  During 2020, other expense, net, of  7.0 million was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction net losses arising mainly from the revaluation of U.S. denominated cash balances held at international locations. During 2019, other income, net, of  28.4 million was comprised primarily of a  29.8 million gain from the Domain Name Sale in the second quarter of 2019.   Benefit from  Provision for Income Taxes  During 2020, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of  12.4 million on pre-tax losses of  20.0 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of 62.3 , as compared to a provision for income taxes of  3.9 million on pre-tax income of  38.3 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.2  during 2019. The change in our effective tax rate in 2020, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to certain discrete items, overall income or loss level, and the change in the proportion of U.S. versus foreign income.  The Tax Act imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax  Transition Tax  on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company recorded a final tax expense of  37.2 million related to the Transition Tax, comprised of a provisional Transition Tax obligation of  40.3 million in 2017 and a subsequent   3.1  million measurement-period adjustment in 2018. The Company has elected to pay the Transition Tax over an eight-year period beginning in 2018, as permitted under the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2020,  28.0 million of the Transition Tax was unpaid, of which  25.1 million is included in Other long-term liabilities and  3.0 million is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of December 31, 2020, we had no U.S. federal net operating loss  NOL  carryforwards and  7.9 million of foreign NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2020, foreign NOL carryforwards, other temporary differences and carryforwards, and credits resulted in deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, of  6.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, we also had a deferred tax liability of  8.2 million primarily due to the debt discount on the Companys convertible senior notes, property and equipment depreciation, and other temporary differences.  As of December 31, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of  1.3 million primarily related to certain foreign tax credit carryforward tax assets that, in our present estimation, more likely than not will not be realized. If we are unable to regain profitability in future periods, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a charge that would materially adversely affect net  loss  income in the period in which the charge is incurred. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we no longer intend to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings and profits. After taking into account the Transition Tax and GILTI tax, we recorded a tax expense of  1.7 million on undistributed foreign earnings of  136.3 million related to foreign withholding tax and U.S. state income taxes in 2020.  Deferred Revenue and Advance Payments  Deferred revenue and advance payments represent amounts received or due from our customers in advance of our transferring our software or services to the customer. In the case of multi-year service contracts arrangements, the Company generally does not invoice more than one year in advance of services and does not record deferred revenue for amounts that have not been invoiced and that require an additional contract. Revenue is subsequently recognized in the period s  in which control of the software or services is transferred to the customer.  The following table summarizes deferred revenue and advance payments  in thousands , as of   December 31,  Current   Deferred product licenses revenue     1,495     Deferred subscription services revenue  26,258  16,561  Deferred product support revenue  156,216  161,670  Deferred other services revenue  7,281  8,395  Total current deferred revenue and advance payments     191,250     187,107  Non-current   Deferred product licenses revenue        Deferred subscription services revenue  8,758  Deferred product support revenue  5,055  3,417  Deferred other services revenue  Total non-current deferred revenue and advance payments     14,662     4,344  Total current and non-current   Deferred product licenses revenue     1,634     Deferred subscription services revenue  35,016  16,658  Deferred product support revenue  161,271  165,087  Deferred other services revenue  7,991  8,932  Total current and non-current deferred revenue and advance payments     205,912     191,451  Total deferred revenue and advance payments increased  14.5 million in 2020, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue from new subscription services contracts, including certain multi-year arrangements and customers converting from product licenses to our subscription services offerings, and an increase in deferred revenue from new product license contracts, partially offset by decreases in deferred product support from certain customers converting from perpetual product licenses to term product licenses or subscription services offerings and the recognition of previously deferred other services revenues. Included in our international deferred revenue balances at December 31, 2020 is a  4.3 million favorable foreign currency impact from the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the same period in the prior year.  We expect to recognize approximately  191.3 million of deferred revenue and advance payments over the next 12 months. However, the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our  satisfaction of various performance obligations, and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and on-going collection of our accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents may include holdings in bank demand deposits, money market instruments, certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury securities. We have also periodically invested a portion of our cash in short-term investments with stated maturity dates between three months and one year from the purchase date. In 2020, we invested a significant portion of our cash in bitcoin. As discussed in Note 2.g, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Digital Assets, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, our bitcoin are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our U.S. entities was  13.7 million and  289.4 million, respectively, and by our non-U.S. entities was  46.0 million and  276.2 million, respectively. We earn a significant amount of our revenues outside the United States and our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were  136.3 million and  231.2 million, respectively. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we no longer intend to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings and profits. After taking into account the Transition Tax and GILTI tax, we recorded a tax expense of  1.7 million on the undistributed foreign earnings related to foreign withholding tax and U.S. state income taxes in 2020.  We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents held by us and cash and cash equivalents anticipated to be generated by us are sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 70,469 bitcoins. We do not believe we will need to sell any of our bitcoins within the next twelve months to meet our working capital requirements, although we may from time to time sell bitcoins as part of treasury management operations, including to increase our cash balances. The Bitcoin market historically has been characterized by significant volatility in its price, limited liquidity and trading volumes compared to sovereign currencies markets, relative anonymity, a developing regulatory landscape, susceptibility to market abuse and manipulation, and various other risks inherent in its entirely electronic, virtual form and decentralized network. During times of instability in the Bitcoin market, we may not be able to sell our bitcoins at reasonable prices or at all. As a result, our bitcoins are less liquid than our existing cash and cash equivalents and may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, upon sale of our bitcoin, we may incur additional taxes related to any realized gains or we may incur capital losses as to which the tax deduction may be limited.  The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows  in thousands  and related percentage changes for the periods indicated   Years Ended December 31,    Change  Net cash provided by operating activities     53,619     60,867  -11.9     Net cash  used in  provided by investing activities      1,018,693        353,687  388.0     Net cash provided by  used in  financing activities     563,233      66,150     951.4     Net cash provided by operating activities. The primary source of our cash provided by operating activities is cash collections of our accounts receivable from customers following the sales and renewals of our product licenses and product support, as well as consulting, education, and subscription services, and, in 2019, consideration received from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures for software development, personnel-related expenditures for providing consulting, education, and subscription services, and for sales and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, and income taxes. Non-cash items to further reconcile net  loss  income to net cash provided by operating activities consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, reduction in the carrying amount of ROU assets, credit losses and sales allowances, deferred taxes, release of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits,  share-based compensation expense, digital asset impairment losses, gain on partial lease termination, and amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs on our convertible senior notes.  Net cash provided by operating activities decreased  7.2 million during 2020, as compared to the prior year, due to a  41.9 million decrease in net income and a  27.7 million decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a  62.3 million increase from changes in non-cash items, which included digital asset impairment losses of  70.7 million. Included in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 is a gain of  21.7 from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs.  Net cash  used in  provided by investing activities. The changes in net cash  used in  provided by investing activities primarily relate to purchases of digital assets, purchases and redemptions of short-term investments, and expenditures on property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was  1,018.7 million during 2020, while net cash provided by investing activities was  353.7 million during 2019. The change in net cash  used in  provided by investing activities was due to a  1,125.0 million purchase of bitcoins and a  564.5 million decrease in proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments, partially offset by a  310.6 million decrease in purchases of short-term investments and a  6.5 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment.  Net cash provided by  used in  financing activities. The changes in net cash provided by  used in  financing activities primarily relate to the issuance of our convertible senior notes, purchase of treasury stock, and the exercise of stock options under the 2013 Equity Plan. Net cash provided by financing activities was  563.2 million during 2020, while net cash used in financing activities was  66.2 million in 2019. The change in net cash provided by  used in  financing activities was due to  650.0 million gross proceeds from our convertible senior notes and a  44.5 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the 2013 Equity Plan, partially offset by a  50.5 million increase in purchases of treasury stock and  14.6 million of issuance costs paid for our convertible senior notes.  Convertible Senior Notes  In December 2020, we issued  650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750  Convertible Senior Notes due 2025. We invested the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes in bitcoin in accordance with our Treasury Reserve Policy pending the identification of working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. The terms of the convertible notes are discussed more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Share repurchases. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to an aggregate of  800.0 million of our class A common stock from time to time on the open market through April 29, 2023 under the Share Repurchase Program, although the program may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program may be funded using working capital, as well as proceeds from any other funding arrangements that we may enter into in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of 444,769 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of  139.12 and an aggregate cost of  61.9 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of 521,843 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of  139.35 and an aggregate cost of  72.7 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.  On August 11, 2020, we announced that we commenced a modified Dutch Auction tender offer  the Offer  to purchase up to  250.0 million in value of shares of our issued and outstanding class A common stock, or such lesser number of shares as are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn, at a price not greater than  140.00 nor less than  122.00 per share. The Offer expired at 5 00 p.m., New York City time, on September 10, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased an aggregate of 432,313 shares of our class A common stock through the Offer at a price of  140.00 per share for an aggregate cost of  61.3 million, inclusive of  0.8 million in certain fees and expenses related to the Offer.  Contractual obligations. The following table shows future minimum rent payments under noncancellable operating leases, payments related to our convertible senior notes  semi-annual interest payments and principal upon maturity , payments under purchase agreements with initial terms of greater than one year, and anticipated payments related to the Transition Tax resulting from the Tax Act, based on the expected due dates of the various installments as of December 31, 2020  in thousands    Payments due by period ended December 31,  Total  2022-2023  2024-2025  Thereafter  Contractual Obligations   Operating leases     133,481     16,738     30,884     25,785     60,074  Convertible senior notes  674,443  4,740  9,750  659,953  Purchase obligations  34,602  13,825  18,378  1,351  1,048  Transition Tax  28,039  2,951  8,486  16,602  Total     870,565     38,254     67,498     703,691     61,122  Unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had  4.6 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. The timing of any payments that could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors, and accordingly the amount and period of any future payments cannot be estimated. We do not expect any significant tax payments related to these obligations during 2021.  Off-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that had a material impact on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  Recent Accounting Standards  See Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A.  Risk Factors.  As discussed under Item 1 of Part I, Business-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial but later emerge as material, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.  Risks Related to General Business Conditions  If we are not successful in developing and delivering competitive product and services offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs, or if our products and services fail to gain or maintain traction with potential customers, our business would be negatively impacted.  Throughout 2020, we continued to update our product strategy to bring to market technologies and related services that build on our history of helping our customers deploy and operate intelligent devices. While we will continue to meet customer commitments previously made, we are developing new products and services that may expand our opportunities in the IoT market. The attractiveness of these new offerings remains uncertain, as does the size of the investment required to bring them to fruition. Our strategy to focus on the IoT market is subject to a number of additional risks and the occurrence of any of them could harm our business     The significant investment of time and financial and other corporate resources required;    Customer acceptance of our IoT-related product and service offerings;    Our ability to cross sell customers;    The ROI model for IoT, which has proven to be elusive for many customers, could further delay adoption of IoT solutions by the market;    Because IoT services are a relatively new offering, the sales cycle may be longer than we anticipate, and;    We may be unable to grow our IoT-related services business rapidly enough to reach profitability in 2021.  Our marketplace is highly competitive, which may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share.  The competition in the growing market for IoT-related software and engineering services is significant. Further, we anticipate that we will encounter and attract attention from increasing competition from a number of new software and service providers as we continue to focus on this market in 2021 and beyond, and as we expand our IoT-related service offerings. We currently face, or expect to face, competition from the following     Our current and potential customers internal engineering and research and development departments, which may seek to provide their own IoT services and or develop their own software solutions which could compete with our IoT-related service offerings and products;    Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating system distributors such as Advantech Co, Letc., Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc. and Dell Computer, Inc.; and    Cloud IoT providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly;    Mid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including and TTTech Industrial North America, Inc. and PTC Inc.; and    Startups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3.AI, Inc., Losant IOT, Inc., and TeamViewer US, Inc.  Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. They may also focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our services and related software solutions, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with AWS or Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.  Neither AWS nor Microsoft has agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete with us. AWS may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partnering with other solution providers that compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in-house, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected system software and services is relatively low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating system software and services, including in the evolving IoT market. These systems integrators may be given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are.  The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic creates uncertainty for Bsquare and our customers, and for the overall global business environment.  As the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, a number of potential risks to our business may emerge and many have already affected our business and our financial results. We may face ongoing challenges selling or delivering our software and services, as our employees and many of those of our customers work from home, are unable to attend company and industry events, and face restrictions on travel and in-person meetings. Closures of manufacturing facilities and warehouses, or staffing shortages, continue to disrupt supply and distribution chains. Our customers could continue to experience a slow-down in demand for their products, decreased budgets, or delayed business initiatives, further reducing the need for our software and services. If our customers global supply chains are disrupted because of COVID-19, they may not be able to meet demands for their end-product and they may reduce or eliminate their purchases from Bsquare for an uncertain period of time, if not permanently. Our customers may be slow to collect from their customers or otherwise face liquidity problems, which may cause delays in satisfaction of their financial obligations to us. Some of our customers may be forced to reduce their workforce through layoffs or furloughs, to cease operations temporarily, or, in extreme cases, declare bankruptcy. In those situations, disruptions to our business could range from a loss of key customer relationships to an inability to timely collect potentially significant receivables.  We experienced a reduction in sales in our Partner Solutions segment since the second quarter of 2020 which we believe is primarily the result of the pandemic. The adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results may continue for an unknown period of time. The extent, depth, and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the on-going rate of spread of the pandemic, variants of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and the speed with which vaccines are manufactured, distributed and delivered. Specifically, our customers demand for our products is uncertain and is likely affected by disruptions in their component supply chains, their own sales cycles, their industry verticals, their ability to sell through traditional distribution channels, their ability to convene or attend employee or industry events, or other factors created and made persistent by the uncertain COVID-19 environment. The decline in Partners Solutions revenue experienced in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 suggest the effect of these disruptions can be significant. The lingering economic effects of COVID-19, even after resolution of the immediate public health crisis, may result in adverse conditions for our business that may impact our financial condition or results.  Our operating results may be adversely affected by changing economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.  Uncertain economic and political conditions in the U.S. and worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may in the future contribute, to volatility in the technology industries at large, particularly in an emerging market such as IoT. These factors could potentially result in reduced demand for our products and services as a result of constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers; purchasing delays; payment delays adversely affecting our cash flow and revenue; and difficulty in accurate budgeting and planning. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.  We received a PPP loan, which may not be forgivable and may subject us to litigation or public scrutiny that harms our business.  In April 2020, we received loan proceeds of  1.6 million under the original Paycheck Protection Program  PPP , which provided for loans to qualifying companies. No payments of principal or interest were due during an initial deferral period, and up to 100  of principal and accrued interest is forgivable if we used the PPP loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and otherwise comply with PPP requirements. We have used the proceeds of the PPP loan for eligible purposes and expect to pursue forgiveness; however, we may have taken or may in the future take action that could inadvertently cause some or all of the PPP loan to become ineligible for forgiveness, which may reduce our liquidity and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The rules surrounding the forgiveness of PPP funding are subject to the political and economic climate and could change, altering our obligations for repayment. Furthermore, if the media, watch groups, government officials or others portray us as a business that should not have availed itself of PPP funding, we may face negative publicity that harms our business and operations.  We may be subject to product liability, infringement or other legal claims that could result in significant cost and ongoing liabilities.  Our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability, infringement and other legal claims. However, it is possible that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations. Although we have not experienced any product liability or infringement claims to date, as our business focus continues to transition to the sale of our own proprietary products, the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future. There is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside, the scope of our insurance coverage, and we may be unable to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future. A product liability, infringement or other legal claim brought against us, whether successful or not, could negatively impact our business and operating results.  Our common stock has experienced and may continue to experience price and volume fluctuations, which could lead to costly litigation for us and make an investment in us less appealing.  Stock markets are subject to significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market price of our common stock may therefore frequently change as a result. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the high and low closing prices of our common stock were  1.83 and  0.93 per share, respectively, but in February 2021 our closing price reached  8.40 per share, and we have not had any recent changes in our financial condition or results of operations that is consistent with the recent change in our stock price. In addition, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of other factors, including quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  including as a result of fluctuations in our revenue recognition , our ability to execute on our current growth strategy in a timely fashion, announcements about technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors, market acceptance of new products and services offered by us, developments in the IoT market, changes in our relationships with our suppliers or customers, our ability to meet analysts expectations, changes in the information technology environment, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, sales of our common stock by existing holders and the loss of key personnel. Possible exogenous incidents and trends may also impact capital markets and our own common stock prices, including but not limited to foreign and cross border altercations, political unrest, cyberterrorism on a global scale, and increasingly disruptive weather systems.  In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys stock, class action securities litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention and resources, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  Our common stock may become the target of a short squeeze.  In the past several weeks prior to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, securities of certain companies have increasingly experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock and buy-and-hold decisions of longer investors, resulting in what is sometimes described as a short squeeze. Short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in those companies and in the market and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Sharp rises in a companys stock price may force traders in a short position to buy the stock to avoid even greater losses. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment as the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. We may be a target of a short squeeze, and investors may lose a significant portion or all of their investment if they purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.  Large customers with significant resources may resort to litigation to recoup economic loss and other damages caused by what those customers perceive to be a deficiency in our products or a breach in our contractual arrangements.  We have a number of larger customers that have entered into longer-term contracts for our products and services. Further, we have actively engaged with those customers in recent months to retool our previously delivered products and to improve our previous agreements. Despite these efforts and investments, new issues may arise, or previous problems may re-occur, causing these customers to choose to initiate litigation against us. While we have no indication that these customers intend to pursue litigation, a decision to do so could cause us to incur significant defense costs, which would be significantly distracting, and may damage our reputation in our markets.  Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and adversely affect our business.  Regulation related to the provision of services on the internet is evolving and increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information, such as the E.U.s Data Protection Directive and General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  and the California Consumer Privacy Act  CCPA . Further, laws and regulations are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the E.U.s ePrivacy Directive and ePrivacy Regulation. Country-specific laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Existing laws and regulations, as well as future requirements, could reduce demand for our products and services or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our products and services in certain locations or our customers' ability to deploy our solutions globally. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards such as GDPR and CCPA may also limit the use and adoption of our products and services, reduce overall demand for our products and services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our products and services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products and services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions.  Changing growth strategies, negative business conditions, changes in useful lives, and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired.  We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs, or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Business conditions and other factors may require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets. Reductions in operating cash flows or projected cash flows of our reporting units could result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results.  It might be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.  Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws and Washington law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority under our articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock. As a result, preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult. In addition, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. The directors in each class serve for three-year terms, one class being elected each year by our shareholders. This system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors. In addition, Chapter 19 of the Washington Business Corporation Act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition, unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporations Board of Directors prior to the time of acquisition. This provision may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company. The existence of these anti-takeover provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  Risks Related to Our Business Operations  Investments in new products and services may not deliver the returns that were anticipated when the development process was initiated, which will have a detrimental effect on our financial results.  As we bring new products and services to market, the acquisition rate, amount, and profitability of the revenue produced by these new offerings will be highly uncertain. Customers may not choose to adopt our technologies or may choose to adopt them more slowly than expected. The investment models that caused us to initiate product development efforts may have contained faulty assumptions about customer adoption rates and or pricing. As a result, we may be required to sustain losses from product development for a longer period than expected, which could harm our financial results and diminish our ability to make additional investments in new products or in improving our existing set of products and services.  Expected operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans may not be realized as anticipated.  Throughout 2019 and 2020, we continued our efforts to reduce unnecessary or excessive costs, with particular emphasis on personnel costs, in order to better align our organizational structure with our strategic focus. Factors which may affect the potential operating efficiencies we realize from our restructuring plans include the adverse impact of job eliminations, uncertainties associated with loss of customer and vendor confidence, potential negative impact on sales and customer service as well as factors outside of our control such as changes in the economic environment. We may not realize the anticipated benefits under our restructuring plans, which could result in additional restructuring efforts. If our restructuring plans are not successful, our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.  The efforts to improve our cost structure and business outlook could result in the departure of key personnel or in costly employment-related litigation. Such outcomes would adversely affect our business and financial results.  After right-sizing the organization throughout 2019 and 2020, we now operate with single and primary points of function and expertise for some positions. These ongoing changes, combined with the tight labor market for technology employees, could cause the sudden departure of key individuals, which could in turn have a detrimental effect on our ability to innovate rapidly and serve our customers. Further, because the market for technology employment remains highly competitive, filling key vacancies may extend these negative effects. Further, employees who have had or who may have in the future their employment relationship terminated, or who are simply disgruntled with the direction of the companys strategy may decide to pursue litigation against us or may choose to disparage us in social media. These activities could damage our reputation, divert our attention from operating our business, and otherwise cause our business to suffer.  Our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property, management, collections, regulatory and other risks.  Customers outside of North America generated 14  and 15  of our total revenue in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We currently have sizable operations outside of North America and in the United Kingdom  U.K. . Our international activities and operations expose us to a number of risks, including the following     Greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property due to less stringent foreign intellectual property laws and enforcement policies;    Longer collection cycles than we typically experience in North America;    Unfavorable changes in regulatory practices and tariffs;    Compliance with complex regulatory regimes or restrictions on import and export of our goods and services;    Complex and or adverse tax laws and or changes thereto. Additionally, we may be subject to income, withholding and other taxes for which we may realize no current benefit despite the existence of significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the U.S.;    Loss or reduction of withholding tax exemptions;    The impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;    General economic and political conditions in international markets which may differ from those in the U.S.;    Increased exposure to potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;    Added cost and administrative burden associated with creating and operating business structures in other jurisdictions;    Potential labor costs and risks associated with employees and labor laws in other geographies; and    The inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business.    On January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited the E.U., commonly referred to as Brexit. As the long-term implications of Brexit become clear, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities, which could adversely impact our operations and business in both the U.K. and the E.U.  These risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices, as well as on our future international revenue, which could negatively impact our business and operating results.  As our customers seek more cost-effective locations to develop and manufacture their products, particularly overseas locations, our ability to continue to sell our software products and services to these customers could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.  Due to competitive and other pressures, some of our customers have moved, and others may seek to move, the development and manufacturing of their smart, connected systems to overseas locations, which may limit our ability to sell our software and services to these customers. As an example, under our current arrangements with Microsoft, we are currently only able to sell Microsoft Windows IoT operating systems to our customers in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean  excluding Cuba , Mexico, and the European Free Trade Association. If our customers, or potential customers, move their manufacturing overseas to locations in which our business may be limited, we may be less able to remain competitive, which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.  Past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate, and future acquisitions, if any, could disrupt our business, dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results and may not accrete to our revenue or other operating results or to our business generally.  We have acquired the technologies, assets and or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies, products, services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy. If we fail to properly evaluate, integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. In addition, acquisitions may not be as accretive to our revenue or other operating results as expected. To successfully complete an acquisition, we must properly evaluate the business, technology, market and management team of the acquisition target, accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction, including accounting charges and transaction expenses, integrate and retain personnel, combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products, research and development, sales, marketing and support operations. If we fail to do any of these, we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees, customers and strategic partners. Additionally, acquisition activities may distract management from day-to-day operations. We also may be unable to maintain consistently uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across our entire business as a result, and significant additional demands may be placed on our management and our operations, information services and financial, legal and marketing resources. Finally, acquired businesses may result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which may involve compliance with foreign laws, payment of taxes, labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses, which could be significant.  We could become subject to taxation in jurisdictions in which we do not believe we currently have tax nexus, which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past.  We sell in many jurisdictions across the United States. We believe we do not have nexus in most of these jurisdictions and, therefore, we believe we are not subject to sales, franchise, income and other state and local taxes in such jurisdictions. However, if we are determined to have tax nexus in other jurisdictions  as a result of more aggressive interpretations of nexus by taxing jurisdictions or otherwise  and we are unable to pass through this cost to our customers, our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations. Further, because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex, we anticipate that our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, we may have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes of which we are unaware, and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations.  Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.  We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate including     the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;    the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;    changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;    increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;    changes in availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;    changes in share-based compensation; and    changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.  There may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change.  We did not generate taxable income in 2020 or 2019 and, as a result, we were unable to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards with respect to such tax years. In addition, Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code restrict the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third-party study, and do not believe that an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, has occurred. However, if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware, or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future, we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards. Further, to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years, the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties. If we are unable to utilize our carryforwards and or if we previously utilized carryforwards to which we were not entitled, it would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.  Risks Related to Technology and Intellectual Property  Our software or hardware products or the third-party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services.  Software and hardware components as complex as those needed for dedicated purpose intelligent systems frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. We have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and, in some cases, have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products. Some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work. To the extent that we repair or replace products, our expenses may increase. In addition, it is possible that by the time defects are repaired, the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue.  Moreover, to the extent that we provide increasingly complex and comprehensive products and services, particularly those focused on IoT hardware, and rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products, we will be dependent on the ability of such third-party manufacturers and suppliers to correct, identify and prevent manufacturing errors or defects. Errors or defects that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs, all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results.  Our business and operations would be adversely impacted in the event of a failure or interruption of our IT infrastructure.  The proper functioning of our IT infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation and management of our business. Despite ongoing mitigation efforts, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology infrastructure and our operations from these IT-related and other potential disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtime, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or personal information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.  Interruptions or delays in services from third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery and availability of our products and services and harm our business.  We currently serve certain customers through third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any damage to, or failure of, these systems generally could result in interruptions in the availability of our products and services. We have from time to time experienced, and may continue to experience, such interruptions, which could cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our customer attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our product and services offerings are unreliable. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to support and provide warranties for these third-party systems, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations for technology or services we did not develop or sell, all of which could harm our business. Further, third-party software and cloud platforms that we currently or may in the future utilize may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms, or may become unavailable. Any of these outcomes could significantly increase our expenses and result in delays in the provisioning of our products and services until we are able to procure alternative solutions, either by developing equivalent technology or, if available, obtaining such technology through purchase or license from other third parties.  We do not control the operation or security of any of these hosting facilities or cloud computing platforms, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. Despite precautions taken by providers of these facilities and platforms, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities or platforms without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities or platforms could result in lengthy interruptions in or cessation of our services.  Breaches in data security or incidents of cybercrime could damage our customers business and our reputation, which may harm our ability to gain new customers or cause our existing customer to look to our competitors for products and services.  Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary data and personal information and security breaches could result in a risk of loss of this data or information, litigation and possible liability. While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive personal information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers data, our data or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third-party technology providers to access their customer data, and some of our customers may not have adequate security measures in place to protect their data. Because we do not control the IT security of our customers or third-party technology providers, or of the processing of such data by third-party technology providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our products and services. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.  Our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages.  It is difficult to determine whether our software products and engineering services infringe third-party intellectual property rights, particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed. If we were to discover that one of our software products or service offerings, or a product based on one of our reference designs, violated a third partys proprietary rights, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, to continue offering that product or service. Similarly, third parties may claim that our software products and services infringe their proprietary rights, regardless of whether such claims have merit. Any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results. In certain cases, we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third-party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others. However, any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount. Even if we receive broad third-party indemnification, these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement.  In addition, in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services. We may face claims of infringement or invalidity related to the software products and services we provide or arising from the incorporation by us of third-party technology and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims. Some of our competitors have, or are affiliated with companies with, substantially greater resources than we have, and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows, and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us, we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products, or delivering services based on the infringing technology, unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights. We may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms, or at all. If such license were not obtained, we would be required to cease these related business operations, which could negatively impact our business, revenue and operating results.  If we are unable to license key software from third parties, our business could be harmed.  We sometimes integrate third-party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third-party software offerings on a standalone basis, such as we do with Microsoft Windows IoT and Mobile operating systems under our OEM Distributor Agreements  ODAs  with Microsoft. If our relationships with these third-party software vendors were to deteriorate, or be eliminated in their entirety, we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In the event that we are unable to obtain these third-party software offerings, we would be unable to continue to generate revenue from our reseller relationships or, with respect to our proprietary software and engineering services offerings, we would be required to develop this technology internally, assuming it was economically or technically feasible, or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace, which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products, or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results.  If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may be able to use our technology which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenue and increase our costs.  We rely primarily on confidentiality policies and procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property. These laws, policies and procedures provide only limited protection. It is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some, or all, of our software products and services. If that occurred, we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents. The patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Similarly, it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws may not be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us.  We license our computer source code to customers. Customers with access to our source code may not comply with the license terms. We may not discover any violations of the license terms and, in the event of discovery of violations, we may not be able to successfully enforce the license terms or recover the economic value lost from such violations. To license some of our software products, we rely in part on shrink-wrap and click wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and, therefore, may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. As with other software, our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected, and policing such unauthorized use is difficult.  A significant portion of our marks include the word BSQUARE. Other companies use forms of BSQUARE in their marks alone, or in combination with other words, and we cannot prevent all such third-party uses. We license certain trademark rights to third parties. Such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand, dilute its recognition in the marketplace, or confuse potential customers, all of which could harm our business.  The computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation, which is often complex and expensive, and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity. Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results.  Risks Related to Our Partnership with Microsoft  We provide software and services to customers building devices utilizing Microsofts Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems. As a result, Microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business. The following Microsoft-related risks may negatively impact our business and operating results.  If we do not maintain our distribution relationship with Microsoft as currently structured, our revenue would decrease, and our business would be adversely affected.  We have entered into ODAs with Microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems to customers in North America, South America, Central America  excluding Cuba , Japan, Taiwan, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The ODAs to sell Windows Mobile operating systems are effective through April 30, 2022. If any of our other ODAs are terminated by Microsoft  which Microsoft can do unilaterally  or not renewed, Partner Solutions revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted. Future renewals by Microsoft, if any, could be on less favorable terms, which could also negatively impact our business and operating results.  We currently recognize revenue from the sale of Microsoft software generally upon shipment of physical software licenses. If Microsoft were to change the method of providing software licenses to a digital rather than physical medium, our revenue recognition policies may need to change, and that change in policy could result in a significant decrease in revenue. While such a change is not expected, and would not immediately impact our cash flows, the full financial scope of the impact is uncertain and potentially significantly negative.  Microsoft can change its product pricing at any time, and unless we are able to pass through price increases to our customers, our revenue, gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted.  Further, Microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our resale activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives. If Microsoft changes the way that rebates are earned by eliminating or negatively modifying the rebate program, our gross profit and operating results would be adversely impacted. In the second quarter of 2020, Microsoft changed the way a portion of its earned rebate may be claimed. While the change enacted in 2020 resulted in a net increase in rebates provided to us by Microsoft, future changes could have the opposite effect. If we are unable to meet the new rebate criteria, should the criteria be modified, we may not be able to sustain the financial benefits of the rebate program and our operating results could be harmed.  Our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by changes Microsoft implements in its pricing of its operating systems.  Microsoft has historically implemented significant pricing changes for its operating systems products and Microsoft could make further pricing changes in the future. These changes have altered the competitive dynamics because the same pricing discounts are available to all distributors of these Microsoft products. As a distributor of Microsoft products, this may impact both the sales prices we charge our customers and the cost of goods sold that we incur for many of the Microsoft products we sell. Microsoft has indicated that a new version of an operating system product we frequently sell to customers will be released in the near future. While Microsoft has not indicated the pricing of this new product version, any significant declines in the market price for the product will reduce our revenue and may reduce our gross profits. The amount and impact of the change, and other pricing changes, on our revenue and gross profit are currently not determinable; however, they may negatively impact our operating results in future reporting periods.  Microsoft offers certain consumer Windows phone and tablet-based operating systems to customers free of charge, subject to certain limitations. While we do not distribute these operating systems today under our ODAs with Microsoft, if Microsoft were to offer, free of charge, operating systems that we do distribute, our business and results of operations would be adversely impacted.  In recent years, the markets for Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems have declined; if the markets for these operating systems continue to decline or decline more rapidly than anticipated, our business and operating results would be materially harmed.  A significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices running various Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems. In recent years, the markets for these systems have declined. If the markets for these operating systems continue to decline or decline more rapidly than anticipated, our business and operating results would be negatively impacted. Continued market acceptance of Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems will depend on many factors, including     Microsofts development and support of various Windows IoT and Windows Mobile markets. As the developer and primary promoter of Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems, if Microsoft were to decide to discontinue or lessen its support of these operating systems, potential customers could select competing operating systems, which could reduce the demand for our Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile software products and engineering services, from which a significant portion of our revenue continues to be generated;    The ability of the Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart connected systems market, including iOS from Apple, Inc.; VxWorks and Linux from WindRiver Systems Inc.; Android from Google Inc.; QNX from BlackBerry Limited; and other proprietary operating systems. Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems may be unsuccessful in capturing or retaining a significant share of the smart connected systems market in the future;    The acceptance by customers of the mix of features and functions offered by Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems; and  The willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications running on Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems is uncertain. To the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to users than those available on Microsoft Windows IoT and Windows Mobile operating systems, this could cause potential customers to select competing operating systems and our revenue could decline.  Microsoft has audited our records under the ODAs in the past and may audit our records again in the future, and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and or the termination of our distributor relationship with Microsoft.  There are provisions in the ODAs that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for auditing purposes. Non-compliance with these or other contractual requirements could result in the termination of our distributor relationship with Microsoft. Microsoft conducted previous audits of our records pertaining to the ODAs, none of which had material findings. It is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found. We may also be contractually liable for payment of royalties to Microsoft in the event that certificates of authenticity are lost, damaged or stolen."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, Business-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.  Overview   Bsquare is a software and services company that designs, configures, and deploys technologies that solve difficult problems for manufacturers and operators of connected devices. Our customers choose Bsquare to help realize the promise of IoT to transform their businesses. Our products include software that connect devices to create intelligent systems that are cloud-enabled, contribute critical data, and facilitate distributed control and decision making. Our services include 24 7 IoT operations that allow our customers to focus on their businesses while we take care of security, monitoring, and general technology updates. The opportunity to help companies explore and capture the value of IoT is attractive and growing. In the last two years alone, we helped hundreds of companies deploy and manage over two million devices. We operate large IoT systems for our customers with device fleets that range in size and complexity. We believe we offer a unique combination of expertise in device-level solutions, embedded operating systems, and IoT services and software that is valued by a global customer base, from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies, across a diverse set of industries.  In 2020, we continued our initiatives commenced in 2019 to reposition our business. We believe the additional focus we placed on serving our customers contributed to the financial and operating results of 2020.  Revenue and Customers  The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted our customer ordering patterns, causing a significant disruption to our Partner Solutions business in 2020. After an exceptionally strong revenue in the first quarter, we saw a significant decrease in Partner Solution revenue in the second quarter. Partner Solutions revenue improved and stabilized in the third and fourth quarters, but at levels lower than our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We suspect our Partner Solutions revenue also decreased because competing Microsoft distributors offered deep discounts on Windows IoT OS software as part of hardware   software bundles. We expect this will continue in 2021. We are working aggressively to retain our large customers and attract new customers with superior service and technical support, pricing that rewards loyalty, and a path to IoT operations.  Investments made to ensure we were meeting our operating commitments, while re-tooling and addressing issues with software previously delivered to some of our larger IoT customers, started to pay off in 2020. We expanded our relationship with Itron, Inc.  Itron  and our work helping them build their intelligent utility grid. We anticipate investments in our other large IoT customers will continue in 2021, but at lower levels than in 2020 as the bulk of the rework is now complete. Beyond gaining credibility as a reliable technology partner, we believe the experience we have gained serving Itron and our other large IoT customers positions us to improve our IoT software and services in 2021 and beyond.  Expenses and Operating Results  Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we had one of our strongest years in recent history. 2020 operating loss and net loss improved dramatically over 2019, by  7.5 million and  7.3 million respectively. These strong results became possible through prior efforts to enter 2020 with an expense structure that made sense for our business and an entrepreneurial leadership team that acted on changing business circumstances and opportunities as they emerged. We believe this operating discipline demonstrates our ability to manage through adversity.  Cash and Liquidity  Our cash and cash equivalents increased by  2.4 million during 2020. Our access to loan proceeds from the  1.6 million PPP loan supported our efforts to maintain our engineering staffing levels and pursue new opportunities created by our unique expertise. Our current cash balance and lack of debt service obligations  other than any unforgiven portions of our PPP loan principal  have provided sufficient liquidity for the business.  Critical Accounting Judgments  Revenue recognition  We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers.  Embedded operating system software  We sell embedded operating system software licenses based upon a customer purchase order, shipping a certificate of authenticity  COA  to satisfy this single performance obligation. These shipments are also subject to limited return rights; historically, returns have been insignificant. We recognize revenue from third-party products at the time of shipment when the customer accepts control of the COA.  Proprietary software  We sell our proprietary software products to customers under a contract or by purchase order. Our Edge to Cloud software contracts generally include professional services, a perpetual or term license and support and maintenance. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined. Contracts that include software customization may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one distinct performance obligation. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation. We then look to how control of the software transfers to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. In contracts that include customer acceptance, we recognize revenue when we have delivered the software and received customer acceptance. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance over the service delivery period. We recognize revenue from royalties in the period of usage.  Our software products generally do not include customization or modification services and are sold in the form of term licenses. These software licenses represent one distinct performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the software is delivered to the customer.  Professional services  We enter into contracts for professional services, including for our IoT-related service offerings, that include software development and customization. We identify each performance obligation in our professional services contracts at contract inception. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The contract pricing is either at stated billing rates per service hour and material costs or at a fixed amount. Services provided under professional engineering contracts generally result in the transfer of control of the applicable deliverable over time. We recognize revenue on service contracts based on time and materials as we have the right to invoice. We recognize revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation. Certain professional service contracts include substantive customer acceptance provisions, in which case we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance.  The determination of the total labor hours expected to complete the performance obligations on fixed fee contracts involves significant judgment. We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates when the causal facts become known. In certain situations, when it is impractical for us to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, an adjusted cost-based input method is used for revenue recognition. Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.  Leases  We lease office facilities, primarily under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2027. These leases generally contain renewal options for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement, which we have an option to exercise at the end of the initial lease term.  We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. On our balance sheet, our office facility leases are included in Right-of-Use  ROU  assets and related lease liabilities are included in the Operating leases and Operating leases, long-term statement line items. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreements. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the term of the lease. For leases that do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. We will use the implicit rate in the lease when readily determinable. The Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on price indices. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Intangible assets  We evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships arising from business acquisitions. We periodically assess the value of our intangible assets. Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we assess the likelihood of recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.  Taxes  As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets. We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. We are required to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances. As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances. The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items,  i  the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented,  ii  the historical sources of income and losses,  iii  the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income,  iv  the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and  v  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.  Our sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States. The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment. Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and complex. We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.  Results of Operations  The following table presents our summarized results of operations for the periods indicated. Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.

Total revenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased sales in our Partner Solutions segment, primarily in North America and Asia, as well as decreased revenue in our Edge to Cloud segment.  Additional revenue details were as follows   Year Ended December 31,   In thousands, except percentages     Change    Change  Revenue   Partner Solutions    42,257    50,628     8,371     17     Edge to Cloud  4,887  8,655   3,768     44     Total revenue    47,144    59,283     12,139     20     As a percentage of total revenue   Partner Solutions        Edge to Cloud        Partner Solutions revenue  Partner solutions revenue decreased  8.4 million and 17  in 2020 compared to 2019,We believe customer demand for embedded operating systems was adversely impacted by the economic downturn and related uncertainty stemming from the global COVID-19 pandemic. We have some customer concentration in industries particularly impacted by COVID-19, such as casino gaming, hospitality, and point-of-sale systems.  Edge to Cloud revenue  Edge to Cloud revenue decreased  3.8 million and 44  in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to professional services revenue earned in 2019 that was not repeated in 2020. We expect Edge to Cloud revenue will continue to vary in timing and amounts.  Gross profit and gross margin  Cost of Partner Solutions revenue consists primarily of the cost of embedded operating system software product costs payable to third-party vendors, net of rebate credits earned through Microsoft's distributor incentive program. Cost of Edge to Cloud revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.  Gross profit and gross margin were as follows   Year Ended December 31,   In thousands, except percentages     Change    Change  1   Partner Solutions gross profit    7,086    7,430     344     5     Partner Solutions gross margin        -     Edge to Cloud gross profit       2,666     2,026     76     Edge to Cloud gross margin        -   18     Total gross profit    7,726    10,096     2,370     23     Total gross margin        -   1      1  For gross margin, amounts represent percentage point change.  Partner Solutions gross profit declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower third-party software sales. Partner Solutions gross margin was favorably impacted by rebate credits earned through Microsofts distributor incentives program. In accordance with program rules, we allocate a portion of the incentive earnings to reduce cost of revenue with the remaining portion utilized to offset qualified marketing expenses in the period the expenditures are claimed and approved. During 2019, 20  was allocated to offset cost of revenue and the remaining 80  was potentially available to offset qualified marketing expenses. During the second quarter of 2020 the program allocation was changed by Microsoft to a 50 50 split between the two components. In 2020, we recorded approximately  757,000 in rebate credits as an offset to cost of revenue compared to approximately  314,000 in 2019.  Partner Solutions gross margin was also favorably impacted by a small amount of revenue for which only the margin is recognized as revenue given our role as agent in the transaction.  Edge to Cloud gross profit and gross margin decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreased sales of software and services in 2020 compared to 2019 and lower margin project work.  Operating expenses  Operating expenses were as follows   Year Ended December 31,   In thousands, except percentages     Change    Change  Operating expenses   Selling, general and administrative    9,314    11,316     2,002     18     Research and development  5,751   5,485     95     Restructuring costs  -  2,343   2,343    -    Total operating expenses    9,580    19,410     9,830       As a percentage of total revenue   Selling, general and administrative        Research and development        Restructuring costs  -       Selling, general and administrative  Selling, general and administrative  SG A  expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees  such as consulting, legal, audit and tax . SG A expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower salaries and related benefits resulting from prior period restructuring efforts, and from lower professional services fees and contract labor. These reductions were partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense.  Research and development  Research and development  R D  expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, and contractor and consultant costs. R D expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower salaries and related benefits resulting from restructuring efforts in prior periods, including the elimination of R D positions.  Restructuring costs  Restructuring costs incurred during 2019 include  1.9 million in severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction plan announced by management in the second quarter of 2019 and a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2019 of  0.4 million related to certain software development cost assets. There were no restructuring costs incurred during 2020.  Other income  loss , net  Other income and loss consist primarily of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower total interest earned on our cash and investments and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.  Income taxes  Income tax expense for 2020 and 2019 related to state and local income taxes.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2020, we had  13.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments  including  0.3 million in restricted cash , compared to  10.6 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a net increase of approximately  2.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We generally invest our excess cash in high quality marketable investments. These investments generally include corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds, although specific holdings can vary from period to period depending upon our cash requirements. Our investments held at December 31, 2019 had minimal default risk and short-term maturities. There were no investments held at December 31, 2020.  Operating activities provided cash of approximately  1.1 million in 2020, which included a net loss of  1.9 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of  1.4 million and a change in working capital of approximately  1.5 million. Operating activities used cash of approximately  6.0 million in 2019, which included a net loss of approximately  9.2 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately  1.8 million and a change in working capital of approximately  1.4 million.  Investing activities provided cash of approximately  2.0 million in 2020, primarily due to net cash inflows on short-term investments of  2.3 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of  0.3 million. Investing activities provided cash of approximately  3.9 million in 2019, primarily due to net cash inflows on short-term investments of  4.3 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of  0.4 million.  Financing activities provided  1.6 million of cash in 2020 due to proceeds from the PPP Loan. There was no cash provided by financing activities in 2019.  We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.

More than one hundred eighty leading brands use eGains cloud software to improve customer satisfaction, empower agents, reduce service cost, and boost sales.  Industry Background  Introduction  Customer relationship management  CRM  tools are not designed to serve as systems of engagement because they are primarily systems of record. They do not offer rich applications to engage customers across digital touch points, nor do they escalate conversations with context across self-service to agent assistance. Furthermore, CRM systems mostly view knowledge management as traditional document management - a big content model that does not work the personalized, media-rich, and content-heavy digital world. Frontline agents, in the CRM worldview, are supposed to have super-human capacity to retain and routinely refresh all relevant knowhow across complex, expanding product portfolios and compliance-heavy processes. Finally, the concept of in-band guidance for customer self-service and agent assistance is foreign to CRM systems. The reality of CRM desktops in contact centers today, we believe, is that agents ignore 90  of the data piled up their application screens-most of which is hidden behind multiple tabs. According to Gartner, 84  of agents surveyed are not satisfied with their desktop tools. It is time to reimagine the Agent Experience.  Digital Economy Demands Modern Software  In a world selling commoditized products to information-rich customers short on time, smart engagement must automate the routine and augment the interesting across agent, business and customer. Therefore, businesses are increasingly seeking digital-first, modern software platforms to layer on top of their traditional systems like CRM, contact centers, and content management. Customer engagement platforms must be designed to be systems of engagement, enabling rapid innovation, delivering quick value and integrating with systems of record across the enterprise. Agile, comprehensive, scalable, and cost-effective, they must demonstrably automate customer self-service, empower agents and easily orchestrate contact center operation in an omnichannel environment.  AI-Knowledge Powered Customer Engagement Automation  Energized by big-data, cloud-computing and open-source technologies in a digital world, AI-Knowledge can deliver transformational value, within a digital-first, omnichannel customer interaction framework. Smart, connected experiences can be automated to successfully resolve majority of customer interactions in most B2C businesses. The pressing challenge for solution buyers, however, is to separate the wheat from the chaff as they look for trusted, innovative and aligned partners. They seek sustained product leadership, at-scale proof points and no-risk trials.  Contact Centers are the Battleground  Contact centers offer a significant opportunity to automate customer engagement. Globally, there are close to 15 million contact center agents. Time-starved customers consuming complex products and grappling with marketing offers generate stubbornly high levels of customer contact. Furthermore, contact centers worldwide are undergoing a technology refresh cycle from on-premise voice-centric models to cloud-based omnichannel platforms. This transition affords businesses the opportunity to reimagine and design new customer contact strategies to drive digital-first automation, fueled by AI-Knowledge.  Customer Engagement Automation is a Large, Growing Market  Businesses are investing heavily in digital transformation, with customer engagement as a top priority. Ease of innovation in cloud and a growing application programming interface  API  economy present exciting capability to connect, solve, and optimize. This is both an opportunity and a challenge. As predicted by industry analysts, the number of customer interactions involving emerging technology such as machine-learning applications, chatbots, or mobile messaging is increasing every day. To effectively harness such novel capabilities, businesses are looking toward innovative platform providers with proof at scale to guide them on their automation journey.  The eGain Approach and Benefits  What Customers Want  Technology acceleration notwithstanding, human needs for customer engagement and service change slowly. We believe what customers want is help in three categories  information, transaction, and situational. A given customer contact can morph across these categories as the conversation develops. Therefore, it is critical that an effective solution optimization customer contact across these three categories seamlessly and with context -accounting for machine-human hand-offs, channel switching, multimodal interaction, and conversational pause-and-resume. During these interactions, we believe customers increasingly want to be guided, even anticipated. Siloed solutions like transactional, simplistic chatbots without contextual escalation and supporting knowledge tend to disappoint consumers even more than non-existent self-service options.

We anticipated the need for AI in customer service early and developed an omnichannel customer engagement hub years ahead of competition. With a relentless focus on the customer engagement automation, we continue to add capabilities to enhance our clients investment in eGain. For example, to enable our clients to serve their customers across all channels, our messaging hub out of the box connects with Apple Business Chat, Facebook Messenger, Google Business Messaging, SMS, and WhatsApp. Our third-generation  virtual assistant - powered by AI, machine learning, and knowledge applications - seamlessly layers across our omnichannel platform. Our knowledge and AI solutions lead the market.  Not only do we innovate quicker than others, we stand behind our claim with a unique Innovation in 30 Days offer-a 30-day guided production pilot in the eGain Cloud - at no cost and with no strings attached.  Leveraged Go-to-market Strategy with a Growing Partner Ecosystem  We take our solutions to market through a partner-leveraged enterprise sales model. We started our original equipment manufacturing  OEM  partnership journey with Cisco several years ago. Through Ciscos partner ecosystem and direct sales network, we also resell cloud-based, eGain-branded solutions.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020  which we refer to as fiscal year 2020 , we announced our cloud-based OEM partnership with Avaya for our digital connect portfolio. We are now building an active pipeline with Avaya field sales and their partners.  Finally, we partner with Amazon Connect, a disruptive cloud-based contact center solution. Our integrated proposition delivers the best of omnichannel capabilities powered by AI-Knowledge and Analytics.  Customers  We mostly sell to large enterprises, which we define as businesses with over a billion dollars in annual revenue or government organizations. Approximately 90  of our annual recurring cloud revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021  which we refer to as fiscal year 2021  came from such large enterprises.  We focus on the following verticals  financial services, telecommunication, retail, government, health care and utilities. For fiscal year 2021, domestic and international revenue accounted for 69  and 31  of total revenue.  Two of our largest customers, who are also our partners, accounted for 21  and 13  of total revenue in fiscal year 2021.  Competition  We compete with application software providers, including Genesys Telecommunications, LivePerson, Nice, Verint, Nuance, and Oracle. In addition, we engage in partnerships with some of our competitors, including Salesforce, Microsoft, and ServiceNow.  The market that we compete in is highly competitive and some of our competitors may have longer operating histories, greater economies of scale, greater financial resources, greater engineering and technical resources, greater sales and marketing resources, stronger strategic partnerships and distribution channels, larger user bases, products and services with different functions and feature sets and greater brand recognition than we have. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following   o proven track record of customer success;  o speed and ease of implementation;  o product functionality;  o financial stability and viability of the vendor;  o product adoption;  o ease of use and rates of user adoption;  o low total cost of ownership and demonstrable cost-effective benefits for customers;  o performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of the service;  o whether the software is delivered via the cloud or on-premises;  o ease of integration with existing applications;  o quality of customer support;  o availability and quality of implementation, consulting and training services; and  o vendor reputation and brand awareness.  Growth Strategy  We are investing in multiple programs to accelerate growth.  Invest in Direct Sales and Marketing  We are enhancing our digital marketing to boost brand awareness, based on client success, product leadership and no-risk trial offers. To complement our marketing investment, we are significantly expanding our field sales team to increase high-touch presence in target accounts.  Develop New Partner Relationships  We are developing new partnerships with complementary platform providers  with large customer bases  to enhance their proposition with our AI-Knowledge powered customer engagement capabilities. We have hired a new head of Business Development to lead a team to develop and operationalize such new partnerships.  Land and Expand in the Enterprise  With the sustained progress we have made in customer success, we see a replicable pattern emerging  land enterprise logos with a limited footprint in one business unit, demonstrate business value, and then expand in the enterprise. We believe we are increasing the value of investment in eGain for our clients by deeply integrating our capabilities via our enhanced APIs with enterprise assets like enterprise collaboration platforms, CRM systems, transaction and billing, and content sources.  Migrate Our Remaining Legacy Customers to eGain Cloud  We offer an attractive proposition to our remaining on-premise customers to move to the eGain Cloud where we subsidize the migration service cost in exchange for their multi-year commitment to the eGain Cloud. We expect to substantially migrate most remaining on-premise clients to the eGain Cloud by the end of fiscal year 2022.  Maintain Platform Innovation Leadership  Innovation is in our DNA. We are developing vertical solutions on our platform to better acquire and serve customers. We continue to enhance our core capabilities to improve usability and personalization.  Selectively Pursue Acquisitions  From time to time, we pursue inorganic strategies to strengthen our product portfolio. In 2014, we acquired Exony Limited, a provider of advanced contact center analytics software. Moving forward, we will look for strategic acquisitions that we believe will deliver compelling value faster than organic options.  Sales and Marketing  Sales Strategy  Our sales strategy is to pursue targeted accounts, mostly B2C enterprises, through a combination of our direct sales force and partners. These enterprises typically have thousands of customer service agents in their contact centers and, in the aggregate, communicate with billions of customers each year. We utilize thought leadership and other marketing events to demonstrate our leadership position in the customer engagement software market and highlight our customer successes.  Our direct sales force is organized into teams that include field sales representatives and sales consultants. Our direct sales force is complemented by lead generation representatives and sales development representatives.  We also complement our direct effort with sales alliances.  Marketing and Partner Strategy  Our marketing strategy is to build our brand around innovative and robust products trusted by leading enterprises. We accomplish this via public relations, analyst relations, marketing communications and demand generation. We employ a wide range of marketing avenues to deliver our message, including print and digital, targeted electronic and postal mailing, email newsletters, and a variety of trade shows, seminars, webinars, and interest groups.  Our marketing group produces sales tools, including product collateral, customer case studies, demonstrations, and presentations. In addition, the group performs market analyses and customer reviews to identify and develop key partnership opportunities and product capabilities.  We believe that our partners help extend the breadth and depth of our product offerings, drive market penetration, and augment our professional service capabilities. We believe these relationships are important to delivering successful, integrated products and services to our customers. Our partner portal, eGain Econet, provides comprehensive sales, support and services information for channel partners.  Subscription Services  Our subscription services provide customers with access to our software on a cloud-based platform that we manage and offer on a subscription basis. These subscription services allow our customers to easily consume our product innovation without dealing with infrastructure, installation and ongoing administration. We generally offer these services through a 36-month contract, with pricing based on the number of agents or self-service sessions.  Professional Services  Our worldwide professional services organization provides consulting, implementation and training services to deliver business value, drive customer success and build customer loyalty.  o Consulting and Implementation Services. Our offering includes rapid implementation services, platform-based solution extension, and systems integration services. Our consultants work with customers to understand their requirements, analyze their business needs, and implement effective solutions. We provide these services independently or in partnership with distribution partners who have developed expertise on our platform.  o Training Services. We provide comprehensive training options to customers and partners. Training programs are offered either online  remote training  or in-person at the customer site. We also offer complementary e-learning through our eGain University education portal to our customers and partners.  Customer Support  We offer 24 x 7 customer support via online and phone channels worldwide under support agreements. Our customer support centers are in California, United Kingdom, and India.  Research and Development  The market for our products changes rapidly and is characterized by evolving industry standards, swift changes in customer requirements, and frequent product introductions.  We continuously analyze market and customer requirements and evaluate external technology that we believe will enhance our competitiveness, increase our lifetime customer value and expand our target market. Our product roadmap effectively combines build, partner and buy options.  Intellectual Property  We regard our intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on intellectual property and other laws, in addition to confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business.  As of June 30, 2021, we had 11 issued patents in the United States. In addition, we have a number of pending patent applications in the United States, including one provisional filing and several non-provisional filings. Our issued U.S. patents expire at various times between 2029 and 2035.  We continually assess the strength of our intellectual property protection for those aspects of our technology that we believe constitute innovations providing significant competitive advantages. Future applications may or may not receive the issuance of valid patents or registered trademarks.  We routinely require our employees, customers, and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our products, technology, or business plans. In addition, we require employees to agree to surrender to us any proprietary information, inventions or other intellectual property they generate or come to possess while employed by us. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. These precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, some of our license agreements with certain customers and partners require us to place the source code for our products into escrow. These agreements typically provide that some party will have a limited, non-exclusive right to access and use this code as authorized by the license agreement if there is a bankruptcy proceeding instituted by or against us, or if we materially breach a contractual commitment to provide support and maintenance to the party.  Human Capital  Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefits; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce. As of June 30, 2021, we had 570 employees, including 563 full-time employees, of which 187 were in product development, 203 in services and support, 123 in sales and marketing, and 57 in finance and administration.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we believe our relations with our employees are good, our future performance depends largely upon the continued service of our key technical, sales and marketing, and senior management personnel, none of whom are bound by employment agreements requiring service for a defined period of time.

Part I  Item 1. BUSINESS  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  General  theglobe.com, inc.  the Company, theglobe, we or us  was incorporated on May 1, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. Originally, we were an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. On September 29, 2008, we consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Tralliance Corporation  Tralliance , to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC  Tralliance Registry Management , an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of our Tralliance business, which was our last remaining operating business, we became a shell company, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets.  On December 20, 2017, Delfin Midstream LLC  Delfin  entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with certain of our stockholders for the purchase of a total of 312,825,952 shares of our common stock, par value  0.001 per share  Common Stock , representing approximately 70.9  of our Common Stock.  As a shell company, our operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and we expect them to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs.  As of December 31, 2020, as reflected in our accompanying Balance Sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern for any significant length of time in the future. Notwithstanding the above, we currently intend to continue operating as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Exchange Act.  EMPLOYEES  As of March 1, 2021, we had no employees. Our executive officer currently devotes very limited time to our business and receives no compensation from us. Our executive officer is an officer, director and or stockholder of other companies which may have ongoing business relationships with the Company. See the section in this annual report entitled "}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Relating to Our Business  We may not be able to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. However, for the reasons described below, we do not believe that cash on hand and cash flow generated internally by us will be adequate to fund our limited overhead and other cash requirements beyond the next twelve months. These reasons raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our significant net losses, working capital deficit and need to raise additional capital, which as it noted raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Delfin Midstream LLC  Delfin , the Companys majority stockholder, has continued to fund the Company through loans to the Company. See the section of this annual report entitled Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately  707,000. This deficit included accrued expenses of approximately  24,000, accounts payable of approximately  2,000 and approximately  689,000 in principal and accrued interest owed under the Promissory Note with Delfin.  On a short term liquidity basis, we must receive capital contributions or loans from Delfin or its affiliates in order to continue as a going concern. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, based upon our current financial condition as discussed above, we believe that we will need to raise additional debt or equity capital in order for us to continue to operate as a going concern on a long-term basis. Any such capital would likely come from Delfin, as we currently have no access to credit facilities and have traditionally relied on borrowings from related parties to meet short-term liquidity needs. Any equity capital raised may result in substantial dilution in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, par value  0.001 per share  Common Stock . We intend to use the proceeds from the 2018 Promissory Note and seek other loans from Delfin and related entities, if necessary, to fund our public company operating costs while we explore our options related to the future of theglobe.  Through December 2020, we borrowed a total of  600,000 under an amended and restated promissory note from Delfin, which was increased to  637,500 in February 2021.  The coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic and its impact on debt and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to operate as a going concern.  In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus  COVID-19  was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout other parts of the world, including the United States. The outbreak of the coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis and has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, business operations and the conduct of commerce generally. In particular, the global capital markets are experiencing and may continue to experience periods of disruption and instability, which could be prolonged and which could materially and adversely impact the broader financial and credit markets. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, which in turn could impact our ability to operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months  Our management may have other interests that may conflict with the interests of our stockholders.  Mr. Jones became our Chief Executive Officer in 2018. Mr. Jones currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Fairwood, which is a material stockholder of Delfin, our controlling stockholder. Mr. Jones is a material stockholder of Delfin and also maintains directorships, investments and participations with and in other companies and entities, including those that may be involved in the gas and or energy business. Although there are currently no relationships between the Company and these entities, Mr. Jones, due to his relationship with such entities, will have an inherent conflict of interest in making any decision related to transactions between the related entities and the Company. Furthermore, since Mr. Jones is also the sole member of our Board of Directors  the Board , our Board presently is not independent. In the event that we have independent directors in the future, we intend to review related party transactions on a case-by-case basis.  We currently have no business operations and are a shell company.  Immediately following the closing of the Tralliance Purchase Transaction, we became a shell company with no material operations or assets, and no source of revenue other than under the net revenue earn-out arrangement with Tralliance Registry Management. We expect that our future operating expenses as a public shell company will consist primarily of customary public company expenses, including legal, audit and other miscellaneous public company costs which will need to be paid by Delfin. In addition, our lack of operations, assets and current prospects makes it difficult for investors to evaluate our future performance.  We may require additional financing to maintain our reporting requirements and administrative expenses.  We have no meaningful revenues and are dependent on our cash on hand to fund the costs associated with the reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, and other administrative costs associated with our corporate existence. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred net losses of  163,836 and  211,374, respectively. General and administrative expenses include customary public company expenses, including outside legal and audit fees, insurance and other related public company costs. We do not expect to generate any revenues unless and until we commence business operations. In the past, we relied on funding from affiliated creditors and we may need additional funding beyond those sources to continue as a going concern. In the event that our available funds prove to be insufficient, we will be required to seek additional financing. Our failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay the legal and audit fees and other administrative costs in order to continue to fulfill our reporting obligations. We do not have any arrangements with any bank or financial institution to secure additional financing and such financing may not be available on terms acceptable and in our best interests, if at all.  We may suffer adverse consequences if we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Act of 1940 and we may incur significant costs to avoid investment company status.  We do not believe that we are an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or a court were to disagree with us, we could be required to register as an investment company. This would negatively affect our ability to consummate a potential acquisition of an operating company, subjecting us to disclosure and accounting guidance geared toward investment, rather than operating companies; limiting our ability to borrow money, issue options, issue multiple classes of stock and debt, and engage in transactions with affiliates; and requiring us to undertake significant costs and expenses to meet disclosure and regulatory requirements to which we would be subject as a registered investment company.  Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  We are controlled by our majority stockholder, which may limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence future corporate action.  As of December 31, 2020, our majority stockholder, Delfin Midstream LLC, holds approximately 70.9  of the issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Accordingly, Delfin continues to be in a position to control the vote on all corporate actions in the future.  The delisting of our Common Stock makes it more difficult for investors to sell shares.  The shares of our Common Stock were delisted from the NASDAQ national market in April 2001 and are now traded in the over-the-counter market on what is commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board or OTCBB. As a result, an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the securities, if at all. The delisting has made trading our shares more difficult for investors. It has also made it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. We may also incur additional costs under state blue-sky laws if we sell equity due to our delisting.  We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock and, consequently, the ability of our stockholders to achieve a return on their investment in our Common Stock will depend on appreciation in the price of our Common Stock.  We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock. Any future dividend payment is within the absolute discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our Common Stock. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend on future appreciation in its value. The price of our Common Stock may not appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased shares. If our Common Stock does not appreciate in value, investors could suffer losses in their investment in our Common Stock.  Our Common Stock is subject to certain penny stock rules which may make it a less attractive investment.  Since the trading price of our Common Stock is less than  5.00 per share and our net tangible assets are less than  2.0 million, trading in our Common Stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. Under Rule 15g-9, brokers who recommend penny stocks to persons who are not established customers and accredited investors, as defined in the Exchange Act, must satisfy special sales practice requirements, including requirements that they make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser; and receive the purchasers written consent prior to the transaction. The Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 also requires additional disclosures in connection with any trades involving a penny stock, including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with that market. Such requirements may severely limit the market liquidity of our Common Stock and the ability of purchasers of our equity securities to sell their securities in the secondary market. For all of these reasons, an investment in our equity securities may not be attractive to our potential investors.  As a shell company, we are subject to more stringent reporting requirements.  We have no or nominal operations and assets, and pursuant to Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, we are a shell company. Applicable securities rules prohibit shell companies from using a Form S-8 to register securities pursuant to employee compensation plans. However, the rules do not prevent us from registering securities pursuant to certain other registration statements. Additionally, Form 8-K requires shell companies to provide more detailed disclosure upon completion of a transaction that causes it to cease being a shell company. To the extent we acquire a business in the future, we must file a current report on Form 8-K containing the information required in a registration statement on Form 10, within four business days following completion of the transaction together with financial information of the private operating company. In order to assist the SEC in the identification of shell companies, we are also required to check a box on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K indicating that we are a shell company. To the extent that we are required to comply with additional disclosure because we are a shell company, we may be delayed in executing any mergers or acquiring other assets that would cause us to cease being a shell company.  Rule 144 is not generally available to holders of our Common Stock which makes it difficult to resell shares in the future.  With limited exceptions related to restrictive securities acquired before we became a shell company, holders of our restricted securities are limited in their ability to resell their securities pursuant to Rule 144. Preclusion from the use of the resale exemption from registration afforded by Rule 144 may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future, and for stockholders to resell their restricted securities.  Our need for capital may create additional risks and create dilution to existing stockholders.  As mentioned above, we will need to raise additional capital in the future, which may be funded from unrelated third party sources, including the incurring of debt and or the sale of additional equity securities. In addition, we may require additional financing to fund working capital and operating losses in the future should the need arise. The incurrence of debt creates additional financial leverage and therefore an increase in the financial risk of our operations. The sale of additional equity securities may be dilutive to the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to us or that it will be available on acceptable commercial terms. Any inability to secure such additional financing on acceptable terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview   As a shell company, we currently have no material operations or assets.  Basis of Presentation of Financial Statements; Going Concern  We received a report from our independent registered public accountants, relating to our December 31, 2020 audited financial statements, containing an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. As a shell company, our management believes that we will not be able to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund our operations and pay our existing current liabilities in the foreseeable future. Based upon our current limited cash resources and without the infusion of additional capital and or the continued forbearance of our creditors, our management does not believe we can operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. See Future and Critical Need for Capital section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  All Note references relate to accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019  Net Revenue  Commensurate with the sale of our Tralliance business on September 29, 2008, we became a shell company, and have not had any material operations since then. As a result, net revenue was  0 for both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses include only those customary public company expenses, including outside legal and audit fees, insurance and other related public company costs. General and administrative expenses totaled approximately  118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and  178,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to less legal fees and no proxy mailing fees in the current year as compared to prior year.  Related Party Interest Expense  Related party interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately  46,000 and  34,000, respectively, and consisted of interest due and payable to Delfin under the Bridge Note. The increase is due to an increase in the amount of money borrowed from Delfin.  Net Loss  Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately  164,000 as compared to a net loss of approximately  211,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Future and Critical Need for Capital  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. However, for the reasons described below, our management does not believe that cash on hand and cash flow generated internally by us will be adequate to fund our limited overhead and other cash requirements beyond the next twelve months. These reasons raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, the COVID 19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our ability to continue operating. Please see Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  In March 2018, the Company executed a Promissory Note with Delfin, which was amended and restated in May 2018 to  150,000, in November 2018 to  350,000, in June 2019 to  465,000, in November 2019 to  554,100, in August 2020 to  600,000, and then again in February 2021 to increase the principal amount to up to  637,500 to pay certain accrued expenses, accounts payable and to allow the Company to have working capital. Interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 8  per annum, calculated on a 365 66 day year, as applicable. The Promissory Note is due upon demand. It may be prepaid in whole or in any part at any time prior to demand. The Company expects continued funding from Delfin over the next twelve months.  Delfin, the Companys majority stockholder, has continued to fund the Company through loans to the Company  see Note 3 . At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately  707,000. This deficit included accrued expenses of approximately  24,000, accounts payable of approximately  2,000 and approximately  689,000 in principal and accrued interest owed under the Promissory Note with Delfin.  Cash Flow Items  Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019  As of December 31, 2020, we had  7,624 in cash as compared to  86,961 as of December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to timing of funding. We receive funding, then use most of those funds prior to receiving more funding. Net cash flows used in operating activities totaled approximately  125,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash flows used in operating activities of approximately  173,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Net cash flows provided by financing activities totaled approximately  46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to  254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due in part to timimg of funding, but also due to a significant decrease in legal costs, requiring less cash.  Contractual Obligations  As a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we have elected scaled disclosure reporting and therefore are not required to provide the table required by  a  5  of this Item.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.  Effects of Inflation  Management believes that inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations during 2020 and 2019.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include valuations of accounts payable and accrued expenses.  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards  Management has determined that all recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not apply to our operations."}

Our People  Global Workforce  We have a very talented team of people operating globally. They are at the center of everything we have accomplished to date and will accomplish in the future. At June 30, 2021 we had a total of 2,344 employees located worldwide, as follows   North America 1,279  Europe 718  Asia Pacific 210  Middle-East 137  We also use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our employee workforce. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been, and remains, intense; particularly for technical and other specialist resources.  Our goal in recruiting people to join Bottomline focuses on attracting, hiring and retaining talented, high-performing employees in all roles and at all career levels. Employment opportunities range from internship programs for students, roles for recent college graduates, entry level positions, management opportunities and executive careers.  We are always conscious of the competitive market for talent and try to be responsive to our employee team needs. We consider employee engagement to be strong. None of our employees is represented by a labor union.  Bottomline Culture  The foundation of Bottomlines culture is embodied in its six Guiding Principles which are reinforced and recommunicated to our entire team regularly   Delight customers  Do the right thing  Innovate, communicate, win and grow  Work with and for each other  Be a company of which all can be proud  Create and grow sustained business value  We are committed to an inclusive environment, ensuring that employees feel safe, valued and respected regardless of race, color, age, gender, disabilities, sexual orientation or any other protected class.  Compensation and Benefits  We strive to offer competitive salaries and benefits in each of the geographies in which we operate. Salary increases were postponed for a period of time during COVID-19 but have recently been restored globally for fiscal 2022 and beyond. We continually evaluate all aspects of the total compensation we offer in each geography to ensure we are offering an appropriate and competitive level of compensation. Similarly, our benefits are intended to be competitive and are tailored to the specific geographical location of the employee based on local laws and customs.  In the United States  which comprises approximately 54  of our employee base at June 30, 2021  we provide health coverage for medical, vision and dental care, disability insurance, flexible spending accounts for medical care expenses, employee assistance programs, paid time off and retirement savings plans.  In the United Kingdom  which comprises approximately 22  of our employee base at June 30, 2021  we provide private medical insurance based on individual eligibility, income protection in the event of long-term illness, life insurance, vision coverage, employee assistance programs, paid time off and retirement savings plans. Health coverage in the United Kingdom is provided predominantly under a government run national insurance program.  Many of these or similar benefits are available to employees outside of the United States and the United Kingdom, in addition to any locally customary or required benefits. For example, our Swiss based employees  which comprise approximately 7  of our employee base at June 30, 2021  are covered under defined benefit pension plans as required by Swiss government regulations.  Employee Well Being  Since March of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly all of our employees, regardless of geography, have worked remotely. We have continued, since that date, to suspend virtually all business related travel. During this period we have provided all employees additional measures of flexibility to adapt to the new demands brought on by this experience, including more flexibility in individual work schedules. We have communicated regularly to employees throughout this period and have consistently reinforced that no one will be required to return to a physical, in-office work setting until it is safe-and until they personally feel safe-to do so. Our team has maintained high productivity and engagement levels during this time. We intend to continue to provide flexibility to our team when we start the physical return to offices, whenever that may be.  Employee Learning and Development  We recently announced two new programs focused on professional development. The first, the Bottomline Growth Series will be available to all team members globally regardless of their level within the organization. The program is designed to provide career advice, success characteristics, positive habits and lessons learned. The second program, Leadership Lessons, will be focused on any team member who directly manages people as well as high potential team members, nominated by the leadership team, who may not yet be managing people. The focus of this program is on leading, developing and motivating high performing people as well as driving transformation and growth.  Open Communications with Employees  We have regular, company-wide employee meetings led by our CEO. During these meetings, any employee is permitted to submit a question either in advance or real-time during the meeting, which our CEO addresses as part of the overall session. All employees have access to a Straight-to-the CEO email portal where questions, comments or concerns can be raised directly to our CEO, including on an anonymous basis. We also maintain a whistleblower program, administered by a third-party organization. Under this program any employee can submit a concern, including anonymously if they wish. Any matter reported through this program is automatically reported to our Chief Executive Officer and to the Chair of our Audit Committee.  We regularly solicit employee feedback through the use of company-wide, pulse-style surveys. The use of these surveys and related outreach has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of these surveys are shared with our CEO, leadership team, Board of Directors and employee team. In our most recent annual pulse survey, we had over 1,800 responses which represented approximately 87  of our then employee base. The responses confirmed our commitment to customers and positive culture of Bottomline with 94  of the respondents indicating they believe Bottomline is committed to customer delight, 88  indicating they would recommend Bottomline to a friend, 87  believed that our commitment to social responsibility, community support and sustainability is genuine and 91  indicated that they are proud to work for Bottomline.  Our Competition  The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We believe our ability to compete depends on factors within and beyond our control, including   our ability to develop new, innovative and feature-rich technology solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the shifting dynamics of the markets we participate in;  the capabilities, performance, reliability, features, ease-of-use and price of our offerings as compared to competitor alternatives;  our ability to attract, retain and develop employees with the requisite domain knowledge and technical skill set necessary to execute against our innovation agenda;  our industry knowledge and expertise;  the execution of our sales and customer success organizations; and  the timing and market acceptance of new products as well as enhancements to existing products, by us and by our current and future competitors.  For our payment platforms, our principal competitors include AccessPay, AvidXchange, Commerce Bank, CSI Enterprises, Finastra, Form 3, Go Cardless, JPMorgan Chase, Kyriba, MineralTree, SWIFT, Tipalti, and Wells Fargo.  For our banking solutions, we primarily compete with companies such as ACI Worldwide, FIS, Fiserv, MeridianLink, NCR, Polaris, Q2 and Temenos.  For our legal spend management solutions, we compete with a number of companies, including Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions, Mitratech, Quovant, and DXC Legal Solutions.  For our fraud and financial crime solutions, we primarily compete with Verafin, Feedzai, NICE Actimize, FeatureSpace and NetGuardians.  Our payment and document automation products compete primarily with companies that provide solutions to create, publish, manage and archive electronic documents and companies that offer payments software and services. We also compete with providers of ERP solutions and providers of traditional payment products.  We believe that we compete favorably in each of the markets in which we participate, however the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in the future, including those discussed in"}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our business, operating results and financial condition. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impact our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.  Risks Related To COVID-19  Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic  The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows and our financial condition. Global health concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions have caused significant disruption to the global economic environment and increased economic uncertainty. There are growing, recent uncertainties related to the evolution of the pandemic itself, including the impact of disease variants, the effectiveness of vaccines against these variants and the consequence to unvaccinated individuals. In response, restrictions have started to be re-implemented by various government bodies and private businesses. There is no recent, comparable event that provides guidance on the myriad of impacts that COVID-19 may ultimately have, however its impact on market and economic conditions clearly remains a significant risk. The long-term consequences of the pandemic remain difficult to predict and depend in large part on the duration of the pandemic and any future recurrence of outbreak, further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers, the demand for our products and our ability to sell and provide new goods and services, including as a result of travel restrictions, employees working from home and other factors. Our customers may also slow-down decision making in respect of new purchases, delay work that had previously been scheduled or seek price concessions or modified payment terms in responses to strains on their own businesses.  Since March 2020 we have continued to take proactive measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees including suspending travel worldwide, temporarily closing our offices and requiring employees to work remotely. While we believe we are currently operating our business effectively in spite of these challenges, substantially all of our employees continue to work remotely.  Deteriorating economic conditions arising from the consequences of COVID-19 such as increased unemployment, a decline in business and consumer confidence and spending or a recession could adversely impact the demand for our products and cause a decline in our revenues. Any material adverse change to our business results would increase the risk of impairment to our goodwill and other intangible assets and any such impairment charge would likely be material. Even after the current COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to be exposed to materially adverse risks to our business as a result of the breadth of its economic impact, including how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume.  Risks Related To Our Business  The markets in which we compete are extremely competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively  The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share or our customer base.  We compete with a wide range of companies ranging from small start-up enterprises with limited resources, with whom we compete principally on the basis of technology features or specific customer relationships, to very large companies which can leverage significantly larger customer bases and greater financial resources. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources, greater brand recognition and a larger customer base than we do. We anticipate that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies and we may not be able to compete successfully with them.  To compete successfully, we need to maintain a successful research and development function. If we fail to enhance our current products and develop new, innovative solutions or if we fail to bring new solutions to market quickly enough, our products could become less competitive or obsolete.  We continue to make significant investments in our existing products and our new product offerings, which may adversely affect our operating results or may not be successful  Given the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment we operate within, we believe that it is important to constantly enhance our existing product offerings as well as to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing and enhancing our products to include what we believe is necessary to meet the future needs of our customers.  Our operating results have consistently been affected by increases in product development expenses as we have continued to make investments in our products and as we have funded new product innovation based on the market opportunities we see. We expect to continue to make investments in product innovation and may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures.  Investments in existing products and new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results and any new product enhancement or offering may not be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. Any significant changes in revenue estimates relating to software development costs we have capitalized could also result in the write-off of previously capitalized costs.  Acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition  An active acquisition program has been an important element of our corporate strategy. We have been an acquisitive company historically, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Any acquisition or strategic investment we have made or may make in the future may entail numerous risks, including the following   difficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, technologies, products or corporate cultures;  entrance into markets and operating geographies in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge;  failure to realize anticipated revenue increases for any number of reasons, including if a larger than expected number of acquired customers decline to renew software maintenance contracts or subscription-based contracts, if we are unsuccessful in selling the acquired products into our existing customer base or if the terms of the acquired contracts do not permit us to recognize revenue on a timely basis;  costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as integration costs, transitional employee expenses and employee retention or relocation expenses, may be significantly higher than expected;  regulatory challenges that may arise prior to or after an acquisition, such as related to governmental review of competition and anti-trust considerations;  write-offs related to existing or acquired assets such as deferred tax assets, goodwill or other intangible assets;  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired company;  inadequacy of existing operating, financial and management information systems to support the combined organization, including the difficulty in integrating an acquired companys accounting, financial reporting and other administrative systems to permit effective management;  difficulties implementing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, policies and procedures;  in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges integrating operations across different cultures and languages and addressing the particular regulatory, economic, currency and political risks associated with different countries or regions;  diversion of managements focus from our core business concerns;  dilution to existing stockholders and our earnings per share;  incurrence of substantial debt;  exposure to litigation from third parties, including claims related to intellectual property or other assets acquired or liabilities assumed; and  failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition due to the above factors or other factors.  There can be no assurance that our acquired businesses will fully integrate successfully or that all future potential benefits will be realized. Any such difficulties encountered as a result of any merger, acquisition or strategic investment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  As a result of our acquisitions, we could be subject to significant future write-offs with respect to intangible assets, which may adversely affect our future operating results  The carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, represents approximately 50  of our total assets at June 30, 2021. We periodically review our goodwill and our other intangible assets for impairment or indicators of impairment and could, in any future period, be subject to impairment charges with respect to these assets or intangible assets arising as a result of acquisitions in future periods. Indicators that our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future revenue or cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the markets in which we participate. Any such charges, to the extent occurring, would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  Catastrophic events may disrupt our business, including our third party data centers  We are a highly-automated business and we rely on our network infrastructure, various software applications and many internal technology systems and data networks for our customer support, development, sales and marketing and accounting and finance functions to process, record, monitor and report data on a continuous basis and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. Our SaaS offerings provide services to our customers from third party data center facilities in different U.S. and international locations over which we have no control. A disruption or failure of these systems or data centers in the event of a natural disaster, pandemic, telecommunications failure, power outage, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Such an event could also prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. While we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, a catastrophic event that resulted in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would likely severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, particularly in the short-term and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We could incur substantial costs resulting from warranty claims or product liability claims  Our product agreements typically contain provisions that afford customers a degree of warranty protection in the event that our products fail to conform to written specifications. These agreements normally contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of warranty and product liability claims. A court, however, might interpret these terms in a limited way or conclude that part or all of these terms are unenforceable. Furthermore, some of our agreements are governed by non-U.S. law and there is a risk that foreign law might provide us less or different protection. While we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims.  A warranty or product liability claim, whether or not meritorious, could harm our reputation, result in substantial financial costs or divert managements attention, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  The failure of our cyber fraud and risk management products to prevent a security breach or detect cyber fraud, or the failure of our customers to take action based on the risks identified by these products, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results  Our cyber fraud and risk management products provide our customers the ability to configure a multitude of settings and establish certain rule-based alerts and it is possible that a customer could misconfigure these products or fail to configure these products in an optimal manner which could cause threats to go undetected. Similarly, if our cyber fraud and risk management products detect threats or otherwise alert a customer to suspicious activity but the customer does not take action to investigate those threats or alerts, customers may erroneously believe that our products were not effective.  Any real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our cyber fraud and risk management products or any failure of these products to prevent, detect or alert a customer to a threat could result in   a loss of customers or potential customers;  delayed or lost revenue and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;  a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance for our cyber fraud and risk management solutions;  an increase in warranty claims;  harm to our reputation; or  litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be expensive and that would further harm our reputation.  We rely on certain third-party hardware and software which could cause errors, interruptions or failures to our solutions or be difficult to replace  We rely on third party hardware and software to deliver certain of our solutions. These third party products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the right to use any of these products could result in delays in our ability to provide our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or acquired from another third party, if available, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis. In addition, errors or defects in third-party products used in conjunction with our solutions could adversely affect the operation of our products.  We face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations  A significant percentage of our revenues have been generated by our international operations, and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on our continued growth and success in international markets. As is the case with most international operations, the success and profitability of these operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include, in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces, the following   currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly with respect to the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, the European Euro and the Israeli Shekel;  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;  differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements;  the complexities of tax laws in foreign jurisdictions;  the complexities of foreign data privacy laws and regulations;  the complexities of various sanctions regimes and related commercial restrictions;  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and  import or export licensing requirements.  We are subject to the political, economic and security conditions in Israel  We have a subsidiary headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighbors, including recently. In the past, Israel has experienced periodic armed conflicts which at times have disrupted day-to-day civilian activity in Israel.  There can be no assurance that future conflicts will not occur and that such conflicts will not affect our premises or major infrastructure and transport facilities in the country, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in Israel. In addition, acts of terrorism, armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect global as well as local economic conditions and adversely impact our operating results.  Our business and operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  We conduct a substantial portion of our operations outside of the U.S., principally in the UK and in continental Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 40  of our revenues and 42  of our operating expenses were attributable to customers or operations located outside of North America. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the foreign currency exchange rate of the British Pound Sterling appreciated against the U.S. Dollar. Future appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies in which our international operations are denominated will have the impact of reducing both our revenues and operating expenses associated with our operations in those regions.  Our future financial results will be affected by our success in continuing to sell our products in a subscription and transaction model, which carries with it certain risks  We generate the substantial majority of our revenue under a subscription based revenue model. We believe a subscription based revenue model has certain advantages over a perpetual license model, including better predictability of revenue; however, it also presents a number of risks to us including the following   arrangements entered into on a subscription basis generally delay the timing of revenue recognition and can require the incurrence of up-front cash outlays, which may be significant;  subscription based revenue arrangements often include specific performance requirements or service levels that we may be unable to consistently achieve, subjecting us to penalties or other costs. A material breach of these arrangements by us, such as a persistent failure to achieve required service levels, might permit the customer to exit the contract prior to its expiration without additional compensation to us;  customer retention is critical to our future growth rates. Some of our competitors may offer more attractive prices or other services that we do not offer. Customers in a subscription arrangement may elect not to renew their contract with us upon  expiration or they may attempt to renegotiate pricing or other contractual terms at the point of  or prior to  renewal on terms that are less favorable to us; and  there is no assurance that the solutions we offer on a subscription basis, including new revenue models or new products that we may introduce, will receive broad marketplace acceptance.  Because we recognize subscription revenue from our customers over the term of their agreements, downturns or upturns in sales of our subscription based offerings will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may adversely affect revenue in the future  We recognize subscription revenue over the term of our customer agreements. As a result, most of our subscription revenue arises from agreements entered into during previous periods. A shortfall in orders for our subscription based solutions in any one period would most likely not significantly reduce our subscription revenue for that period but could adversely affect the revenue contribution in future periods. In addition, we may be unable to quickly reduce our cost structure in response to a decrease in these orders. Accordingly, the effect of downturns in sales of our subscription based solutions will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. A subscription revenue model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional subscription sales in any one period, as revenue is generally recognized over time, rather than up-front.  Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results  Our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and technical and sales employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment methodology and regulation, business banking technologies, and web, database and network technologies. Our success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team. Our current key employees and employees whom we seek to hire in order to support our growth are in high demand within the marketplace. The loss of one or more of our key employees or our failure to consistently attract and retain sufficient qualified employees to grow our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our employees and our employees are generally free to terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  We engage off-shore development resources which may not be successful and which may put our intellectual property at risk  In order to optimize our research and development capabilities and to meet development timeframes, we use our India subsidiary for certain product development activities and we further contract with off-shore third-party development vendors. While our experience to date has been positive, there are a number of risks associated with off-shore development activities including   less efficient and less accurate communication and information flow as a consequence of time, distance and language barriers between our primary development organization and the off-shore resources, resulting in delays or deficiencies in development efforts;  disruption due to political or military conflicts;  misappropriation of intellectual property, which we may not readily detect; and  currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact the cost advantages intended from these agreements.  To the extent that these or unforeseen risks occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.  Regulatory and Compliance Risks  A cyber-attack or security or data breach could have an adverse effect on our business and create the perception that our solutions are not secure  In the course of providing services to our customers we collect, store, process and transmit highly sensitive and confidential information. We rely on our employees and certain third parties in our current operations who may, as a result of human error or misconduct, expose us to operational risk. Certain of our solutions also facilitate the actual transfer of cash or transmit instructions that initiate cash transfer. Our products and services, particularly our SaaS offerings, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service attacks and other disruptive problems, which could result in the theft, destruction or misappropriation of confidential information. Security risks in recent years have increased significantly given the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, organized crime, including state-sponsored organizations and nation-states, and other external parties. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, increasing the difficulty of defending against them and even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The techniques used by bad actors change frequently and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. In addition, employees, customers and other counterparties who may access our network increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are therefore subject to their own cyber-security risks. Breaches of our network could disrupt our internal systems and business applications, including services provided to our customers. Additionally, data breaches could compromise technical and proprietary information, harming our  competitive position. We spend significant capital and allocate significant resource to ensure effective ongoing protection against the threat of security breaches, however these amounts might ultimately prove inadequate. We also maintain cyber insurance but there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses that we may incur would be covered under those policies or that the amount of insurance coverage would be adequate. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee and senior management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and on-going efforts to improve security. Despite all of our efforts, a security breach or computer virus could still occur which could have a significant negative impact on our business, including reputational harm, the loss of customers and material financial liability to us.  If our products and services do not comply with laws, regulations and industry standards to which we and our customers are subject, our business could be adversely affected  Our product offerings facilitate the transmission of cash, business documents and confidential information including, in some cases, personally identifiable information related to individuals and corporations. Our products store and transmit this data electronically, and therefore our products must operate within the laws, regulations and industry standards regarding security, data protection and electronic commerce. There has been an increased global regulatory focus on privacy issues with respect to the handling of personal information, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. Various U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign legislative, regulatory, or other government bodies may enact new or additional laws or regulations, or issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, concerning privacy, data storage, data protection, and cross-border transfer of data that could materially adversely impact our business. For example, in the European Union, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield in July 2020. The U.S.-EU Privacy Shield provided a mechanism to lawfully transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States and certain other countries. If and when we transfer certain personal data from the European Union to the United States, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield will require us to identify alternative legally sufficient mechanisms to transfer such personal data, which could result in substantial costs, require changes to our business practices, limit our ability to provide certain products in certain jurisdictions, or materially adversely affect our business and operating results. While we believe that our products comply with current regulatory requirements, the interpretation and application of these requirements continues to evolve and may evolve in ways that we cannot predict; so there can be no assurance that future legal or regulatory actions will not adversely impact us. To the extent that current or future regulatory or legal developments mandate a change in any of our products or services, require us or our customers to comply with any industry specific licensing or compliance requirements, alter the demand for or the competitive environment of our products and services or require us to make material changes to how we operate our business, including any changes to our internal operating, financial or management information systems, we might not be able to respond to such requirements in a timely or cost effective manner. If this were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Failure to comply with the regulations provided by the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA  for certain of our UK operations could adversely impact our business  A portion of our UK operations involves holding and disbursing client funds and is subject to the regulatory framework of the FCA. The FCA has significant enforcement authority which includes, but is not limited to, withdrawing an organizations authorization, issuing fines and suspending firms from carrying out regulated activities. While we believe we have appropriate controls and procedures around these operations, any failure to comply with FCA requirements may result in disciplinary actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  Defects or disruptions in our products or services could diminish demand for our solutions and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results  Our software products are inherently complex. Despite testing prior to their release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, software and SaaS offerings often contain undetected errors or defects that can impact their function, performance and security. Any unanticipated performance problems or defects in our products or services could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, service disruptions for our SaaS offerings, negative publicity and reputational harm to us and our products and exposure to potential liability claims. As a result, any error or defect in our products or services could adversely affect our future financial results.  We could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and could be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could cause serious harm to our business  We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights. However, there is no assurance that our patents, pending applications for patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology or any commercial advantage to us. Further, we cannot be certain that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We enter into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary information. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, there is no assurance that such rights will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the United States and in other countries where we operate. We may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in reputational harm to us, require us to spend significant sums in litigation costs or damages, delay product implementations, or require us to develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim. In addition, under many of our customer contracts, we are required to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the costs to us of any such claims. These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  We may have larger than anticipated tax liabilities  The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and estimation and there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and the determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by the applicable domestic or foreign taxing authority. In light of fiscal challenges in U.S. federal and state governments and in many international locations, taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues which may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have established tax reserves using assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable, these reserves may prove insufficient in the event that a taxing authority asserts a tax position that is contrary to our position.  Changes in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations  Changes in accounting standards or practices could adversely affect our reported results of operations. New accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements that occur or may occur in the future may materially affect our reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business in future periods.  If we fail to maintain appropriate and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price  Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that we re-evaluate regularly. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, despite our efforts, any failure to maintain or implement the necessary internal controls could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations or result in misstatements in our financial statements, either of which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock.  Risks Related to our Indebtedness  We are party to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders which provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to  300 million  the Credit Facility  through July 16, 2023. At June 30, 2021 we owed  130 million under the Credit Facility.  Our level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility  Our level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including   a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;  we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and  additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and contain restrictive covenants, or may not be available to us.  The factors that will affect our ability to obtain additional financing may be beyond our control and include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need financing.  The credit agreement contains financial and other covenants, and our failure to comply with any of those covenants could materially adversely impact us or limit or eliminate our ability to access funds under the Credit Facility  The credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. Our ability to meet those financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and while at June 30, 2021 we were in compliance with those covenants, we may fail to maintain compliance in future periods. The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including, but not limited to, material adverse events, specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, sales of assets,  dividends and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. These restrictions could place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not subject to such limitations. A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could seek recovery against our assets, including any collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under the Credit Facility were to accelerate the payment of any indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to satisfy our obligations.  Our variable rate could cause our debt service obligations to increase or decrease based on changes in market rates  Borrowings under the Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements intended to mitigate interest rate volatility arising from the Credit Facility, however, the interest rate swaps and any additional interest rate swap we may enter into in the future might not fully mitigate our variable interest rate risk.  Changes to and replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial results and operation  In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA, the regulatory authority over LIBOR  stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rate indices after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. On March 5, 2021 the FCA announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to the overnight, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months USA LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023 and all other tenors after December 31, 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee  ARRC  has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate  SOFR  is the rate that represents the best alternative to LIBOR for derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement in the United States. In addition, other benchmarks may emerge or other rates may be adopted outside of the United States. The market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is expected to be complicated. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Borrowings under our Credit Facility, as hedged by our interest swaps, are indexed to LIBOR. It is uncertain at this time, what the impact of a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial results and operations.  Risks Related To Owning Our Common Stock  Our common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo significant market price fluctuations  The market price of our common stock has recently experienced and may continue to experience significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including   general and industry-specific business, economic and market conditions;  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;  the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;  changes in or our failure to meet analysts or investors estimates or expectations;  public announcements concerning us, our competitors or our industry;  acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;  adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights; and  announcements of technological innovations by our competitors.  We have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the only opportunity for a return on investment in our Company will be if the market price of our common stock increases and acquired shares are sold at a profit.  If our revenues or mix of revenues are below anticipated levels or if our operating results are below analyst or investor expectations, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected  A significant percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel and facilities costs, are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue levels which can be difficult to predict. A decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could adversely affect our business. Significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner.  Quarterly or annual operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our operating results include   a change in customer demand for our products, which is highly dependent on our ability to continue to offer innovative technology solutions in very competitive markets;  the timing of customer orders;  for our cloud solutions, the time it takes us to deliver to the customer a fully functional live production environment, since revenue recognition generally does not commence prior to that achievement;  the timing of product implementations, which are highly dependent on customers resources and discretion;  overall economic conditions, which may affect our customers and potential customers budgets for information technology expenditures;  foreign exchange rate volatility, which can have a significant effect on our total revenues and costs when our foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars;  the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and  the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by either us or our competitors.  Certain anti-takeover provisions contained in our charter and under Delaware law could hinder a takeover attempt  We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibiting, under some circumstances, publicly-held Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock. Such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, even if such events could be beneficial, in the short term, to the interests of our stockholders. In addition, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions relating to the limitation of liability and indemnification of our directors and officers, dividing our board of directors into three classes of directors serving three-year terms and providing that our stockholders can take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders.  General Risks  Weakness or deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results  Our business, financial condition and operating results are significantly affected by general economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic weakness or any downturn in the U.S. or global economies could result in a variety of risks to our business, including   increased volatility in our stock price;  increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates;  delays in, or curtailment of, purchasing decisions by our customers or potential customers either as a result of continuing economic uncertainty or as a result of their inability to access the liquidity necessary to engage in purchasing initiatives;  pricing pressures for our products and services, including reductions in the duration or renewal rates for our subscription contracts and software maintenance contracts;  increased credit risk associated with our customers or potential customers, particularly those that may operate in industries or geographic regions most affected by the economic downturn; and  impairment of our goodwill or other assets.  To the extent that economic conditions become uncertain or deteriorate, or any of the above risks occur, our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom  UK  from the European Union  EU   referred to as Brexit , could create disruption and uncertainty to our business, including our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations  In January 2020, the UK and EU entered into a withdrawal agreement pursuant to which the UK formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. Following such withdrawal, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020. The UK and EU signed a European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement  TCA , which became effective in May 2021.  The ultimate effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on how the terms of the TCA and any future agreements signed by the UK and EU take effect in practice. There remains uncertainties and risks to our business related to Brexit and the new relationship between the UK and EU, which will continue to be developed and defined, as well as any resulting political and economic instability created by Brexit. These uncertainties could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and create uncertainty and challenges  particularly in the near term  with respect to trading relationships between our UK subsidiary and other EU nations. Remaining EU member countries may also seek to make it more difficult for us to trade effectively or competitively in those regions. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to employment law or data privacy, as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, which could create additional uncertainty and challenges for us."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The statements contained in this Annual Report that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended  the Exchange Act . Without limiting the foregoing, the words may, will, should, could, expects, plans, intends, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us up to and including the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully review those factors and also carefully review the risks outlined in other documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC .  In the management discussion that follows, we have highlighted those changes and operating events that were the primary factors affecting period to period fluctuations. The remainder of the change in period to period fluctuations from that which is specifically discussed arises from various individually insignificant items.  Overview   We help make complex business payments simple, smart and secure. We provide solutions that are helping to accelerate the digital transformation of business payments. Corporations and banks rely on us for domestic and international payments, efficient cash management, automated workflows for payment processing and bill review, and fraud detection, behavioral analytics and regulatory compliance solutions.  We operate payment platforms that facilitate electronic payment and transaction settlement between businesses and their vendors. We offer solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that financial institutions use to engage intelligently with customers to acquire, deepen and grow profitable relationships. Our legal spend management solutions help determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims for insurance companies and other large consumers of outside legal services, and provide related tools and analytics for law firms themselves. Corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate payment and accounts payable processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our fraud and risk management solutions are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity to gain protection from internal fraud and external financial crime.  Our solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that the solutions can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for training, consulting and product enhancement.  COVID-19  The United States and the global communities in which we operate continue to face challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, restrictions have been re-implemented by government bodies and private businesses as disease variants have started to spread more rapidly. Like many companies we have been encouraged by the increased availability of vaccines, however there remains significant uncertainty over the duration of the pandemic itself; particularly as the virus continues to evolve. Since March 2020 we have continued to suspend virtually all travel for employees, our offices generally remain closed and our employees have continued to work remotely in most geographies.  While we continue to operate effectively during this challenging period, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the global economy remains uncertain. The ultimate consequences will depend on many factors outside of our control, including the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics and the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic itself; including the impact of the emerging COVID variants.  Certain of our transactional revenue streams, specifically those arising through Paymode-X and Legal Spend Management, were the most significantly impacted during the past year. We have observed that transaction volumes for Paymode-X have begun to return to more normalized levels. Legal Spend Management transaction volumes remained constrained during fiscal 2021 but we saw some modest improvement during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. We are encouraged by these trends and are hopeful that it supports a conclusion that a sustained recovery of volumes is underway.  Financial Highlights  The discussion that follows compares our operating results for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, our revenue increased to  471.4 million from  442.2 million in the prior fiscal year. Our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was favorably impacted by  11.1 million in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to the British Pound Sterling and Swiss Franc, which appreciated against the U.S. Dollar as compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue growth in fiscal year 2021 was driven by revenue increases in our Cloud Solutions and Banking Solutions segments of  30.2 million and  3.3 million, respectively, partially offset by a  4.3 million revenue decrease in our Payments and Documents segment. The increase in revenue in our Cloud Solutions segment was primarily due to increased subscription revenue from our payment platforms. The revenue increase in our Banking Solutions segment was primarily due to new customer engagements and platform go-lives, as customers continued to deploy our hosted solutions. The revenue decrease in our Payments and Documents segment was related to decreased software licenses, service and maintenance and other revenue driven by the continued conversion of our customers to our hosted and subscription based solutions and our focus in selling subscription based solutions to new customers.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, our gross profit increased  21.8 million over the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the revenue increases in our Cloud Solutions and Banking Solutions segments described above. The expansion in our gross profit was offset by increased operating expenses of  25.9 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of  4.0 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by increased sales and marketing costs of  13.5 million and product development and engineering costs of  5.1 million, as we continued to invest in our sales channels and new product innovation, and increased general and administrative costs of  6.6 million. Our net loss was  16.3 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a net loss of  9.2 million in the prior fiscal year.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we derived approximately 40  of our revenue from customers located outside of North America, principally in the United Kingdom  UK , continental Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.  We expect future revenue growth to be driven primarily by our Banking Solutions and Cloud Solutions segments.  On an increasing basis, we continue to make investments in innovative new technology offerings that we believe will enhance our competitive position, help us win new business, drive subscription revenue growth and expand our operating margins. We expect to continue to make investments in our suite of products so that we can continue to offer innovative, feature-rich technology solutions to our customers.  Revenue Sources  Our revenues are derived from multiple sources and are reported under the following classifications   Subscriptions  We generate subscription revenue from the sale of SaaS solutions that can include both fixed and usage-based fees. Our SaaS arrangements consist of an obligation for us to provide continuous access to a technology solution that we host, which we account for as a stand-ready performance obligation. These contracts may also include variable pricing or overage fees based on customer processing, usage or volume. We recognize revenue for fixed subscription fees ratably over the non-cancelable term of the contract, commencing on the date the customer has access to the solution. In circumstances where we meet certain requirements to allocate variable consideration to a distinct service within a series of related services, we allocate variable consideration to each distinct period of service within the series. If we do not meet those requirements, we include an estimate of variable consideration in the transaction price and recognize it ratably over the non-cancelable term of the contract.  For certain of our SaaS solutions, customers may be charged a fee for implementation services. In determining whether the implementation services are distinct from the hosting services we consider various factors, including the level of customization, complexity of the integration, the interdependency and interrelationship between the implementation services and the hosting services and the ability  or inability  of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform the services. We have concluded that the implementation services in our hosting arrangements with multiple performance obligations are not distinct and therefore we recognize fees for implementation services ratably over the non-cancelable term of the hosting contract.  We license software on a subscription basis under contractual arrangements where customers pay a specified fee, inclusive of support and maintenance, for a time-based license right to use our software. These fees recur periodically unless the customer opts to cancel their subscription arrangement with us. These contracts typically contain two distinct performance obligations  the software license and support and maintenance. The portion of the transaction price allocated to the license right is recognized at the point in time in which we have provided the customer access to the intellectual property and the license term has commenced. The portion of the transaction price allocated to support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the non-cancelable contract term.  Software Licenses  Software licenses revenue reflects fees we charge to license software on a perpetual basis. For software licenses that do not include significant customization we recognize revenue at the point in time where the customer has obtained access to the intellectual property and the license period has commenced.  Periodically, our software arrangements require significant customization and modification and involve extended implementation periods. In these arrangements, the professional services and software license are highly interdependent and we treat the software license and professional services as a combined performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the combined performance obligation over time and measure progress to completion based on labor hours incurred as a percentage of total expected labor hours. We believe the use of labor hours as an input measure provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods and services under these contracts.  Support and Maintenance  Our software licenses are generally sold with post-contract support which is comprised of technical support and unspecified software upgrades. Unspecified upgrades refer to software upgrades which we make available at our discretion and from time-to-time, on a when and as available basis. We account for post-contract support as a stand-ready performance obligation and recognize revenue ratably over the non-cancelable contract term which is typically one year.  Professional Services  Our professional services revenue is normally comprised of implementation, consulting and training services. Except for professional service performance obligations that form part of an overall, highly customized arrangement, and for implementation services associated with our hosted solutions, our professional services typically represent distinct performance obligations and revenue is recognized as the services are performed.  Other  Other revenue remains a minor component of our total revenue and is derived from the sale of equipment and supplies which is recognized at the point in time control transfers to the customer.  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  We believe that several accounting policies are important to understanding our historical and future performance. We refer to these policies as critical because they involve areas of financial reporting that require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time we make the estimate and different estimates may also have been reasonable and could have been used. These critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the valuation of acquired performance obligations, capitalized software costs and income taxes. These critical policies and our procedures related to these policies are discussed below. In addition, refer to Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding this matter.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of the product or service to the customer at an amount we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products and services. We recognize revenue according to the following five step model   Identifying the contract  or contracts  with a customer;  Identifying the performance obligations in the contract;  Determining the transaction price;  Allocating the transaction price to the contractual performance obligations; and  Recognizing revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.  Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together can require significant judgment. We account for a good or service as a distinct performance obligation when it is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and when a customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer. In determining whether a customer can benefit from a good or service on its own, we consider the complexity of any required integration or customization, the interdependency and interrelationship of the particular good or service to other items in the contract and the ability  or inability  of the customer's personnel or other third party providers to successfully fulfill like goods or services. If a promised good or service does not meet the criteria to be accounted for as a separate performance obligation, it is combined with other items in the contract and treated as a combined performance obligation. Revenue is then recognized in the amount of the transaction price allocated to the combined performance obligation as the combined performance obligation is transferred to the customer.  The transaction price represents the amount of consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive under the contract and may involve significant estimation particularly in the assessment of variable consideration such as refunds, penalties, usage-based fees or similar items. Unless we meet certain exceptions, we are required to estimate the amount of variable consideration we expect to receive under the contract. In formulating an estimate of variable consideration, we consider the specific customer's operating history with us, current usage data and the length of time over which the fees are expected to be incurred. We include estimated variable consideration in the transaction price if we conclude that a significant future reversal of revenue under the contract will not occur.  Once determined, the transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations in a contract. If a contract only has one performance obligation  for example, a professional services only engagement  the entire transaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each  performance obligation based on the proportionate relationship of that performance obligations standalone selling price to the total transaction price. Determining the standalone selling price  SSP  involves estimation. We determine SSP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions and we typically define SSP as a range for individual products and services, with consideration of the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography. In most cases we use an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate SSP and consider the following   The price we charge when we sell that item separately;  Internal price lists and internal pricing guidelines;  Cost of delivering the item and overall gross margin expectations; and  Information about the customer or class of customer.  Revenue is recognized for each performance obligation as we satisfy the obligation. Performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point in time. Our perpetual and term license obligations that do not include significant customization are normally satisfied at a point in time. Our professional services, support and maintenance, stand-ready performance obligations with respect to our SaaS solutions and software licenses dependent on significant customization by us are normally satisfied over time.  Deferred Costs  Certain costs incurred to fulfill or obtain a contract are capitalized.  We capitalize costs incurred to fulfill a contract when the costs relate directly to a specifically identifiable customer contract, when the costs generate or enhance the resources that we will use to satisfy performance obligations in the future and when we estimate that we will recover the costs through future revenues under the contract.  Costs incurred to obtain a contract are incremental costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained, such as sales commissions. We capitalize sales commissions when we estimate that the capitalized amounts will be recovered through future revenues under the contract and the period of benefit is longer than twelve months.  Any costs that we capitalize are amortized to expense over the period in which we expect to transfer the specific goods or services to the customer. Estimating the expected period of benefit involves judgment. We estimate the future period of benefit after considering a number of factors, including the current contract term, estimated customer renewal terms and the estimated life of the technology solution underlying the contract.  Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets  Goodwill and acquired intangible assets are tested periodically for impairment. We performed our annual impairment test of the carrying value of our goodwill for fiscal year 2021 during our fourth quarter, which is consistent with the historic timing of our annual goodwill impairment review. Our analysis of goodwill impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, which requires an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit.  Based on the results of our annual impairment review we concluded there was no goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of our future impairment reviews. To the extent that future impairment charges occur, it would likely have a material impact on our financial results. At June 30, 2021, the carrying value of goodwill for all of our reporting units was  246.7 million.  We also perform periodic reviews of the carrying value and amortization periods of our other acquired intangible assets. These acquired intangible assets consist primarily of customer related assets and core technology. In evaluating potential impairment of these assets, we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present, including   whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset;  whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used; and  whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life.  If indicators of impairment are present, an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate must be made to ensure that the carrying value of the asset can be recovered. At June 30, 2021, the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, capitalized software and purchased software, was  109.3 million. As a result of our fiscal year 2021 impairment review, we concluded that none of these assets were impaired.  Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets and Acquired Performance Obligations  In connection with our acquisitions, we have recorded acquired intangible assets relating principally to customer related assets and core technology. The valuation process used to calculate the values assigned to these acquired intangible assets is complex and involves significant estimation relative to our financial projections. One of the principal components of the valuation process is the determination of discounted future cash flows, and there are a number of variables that we consider for purposes of projecting these future cash flows. There is inherent uncertainty involved with this estimation process and, while our estimates are  consistent with our internal planning assumptions, the ultimate accuracy of these estimates is only verifiable over time. Further, the projections required for the valuation process generally utilize at least a ten-year forecast, which exceeds our normal internal planning and forecasting timeline. The particularly sensitive components of these estimates include, but are not limited to   the selection of an appropriate discount rate;  our projected overall revenue growth and mix of revenue;  our gross margin estimates  which are highly dependent on our mix of revenue ;  our technology attrition rates and product life cycles;  the attrition rate of our customers, particularly those who contribute to our recurring revenue streams, such as software maintenance and our cloud solutions;  the determination of third party market rates for leases or other contractual rights we acquire, for purposes of assessing whether we have acquired a favorable, unfavorable or at-market contract;  our planned level of operating expenses; and  our effective tax rate by operating geography.  We are also required to estimate the acquisition date fair value of acquired performance obligations that we assume as part of any acquisition. The acquisition date fair value of performance obligations we assume is typically estimated based on the costs we expect to incur in fulfilling the acquired obligations, plus a normal profit margin. Cost estimates exclude amounts relating to any selling effort, since those costs would have been incurred by the predecessor company. In the case of acquired software maintenance contracts, cost estimates also exclude any ongoing research and development expenses associated with product upgrades since these amounts typically do not represent a legal obligation that we assume at the time of acquisition.  Income Taxes  We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States  including its states and municipalities  as well as the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impact of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial statement purposes. The income tax expense we record in any interim period is based on our estimated tax rate for the full fiscal year for those tax jurisdictions in which we can reliably estimate that rate. The calculation of our estimated annual effective tax rate requires an estimate of pre-tax income by tax jurisdiction as well as total tax expense for the fiscal year. Accordingly, our annual estimated effective tax rate is subject to adjustment if there are changes to our initial estimate of total tax expense or pretax income, including the mix of income by jurisdiction. We update these estimates on a quarterly basis, so that our interim financial statements reflect our most current projections for the full fiscal year.  Our income tax expense consists of two components  current and deferred. Current tax expense represents our estimate of taxes to be paid for the current period, including income tax expense arising from uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between when certain transactions are reflected in our financial statements and when those same items are included in a tax return. Deferred tax assets generally reflect the impact of a tax deduction, tax credit or operating loss carryforward that we have available for use in future year tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities generally reflect the impact of a deduction or expenditure that we have already taken in a tax return but have not yet reflected in our financial statements.  We record a deferred tax asset if we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a future tax benefit. Ultimate realization of any deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction before the expiration of carryforward periods, if any. Our assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability considers many different factors including historical and projected operating results, the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities that provide a source of future taxable income, the impact of current tax planning strategies and the availability of future tax planning strategies. We record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax asset for which we are unable to conclude that recoverability is more likely than not. This is inherently judgmental, since we are required to assess many different factors and evaluate as much objective evidence as we can in reaching an overall conclusion. At June 30, 2021, given our history of losses and the absence of any tax planning strategies, the only factor that affected our determination of whether or not a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets was necessary was our assessment of the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities.  We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit we would have otherwise recorded if a tax position is uncertain. In evaluating whether a tax position is uncertain, we base our assessment on existing tax legislation, case law and rulings. We also presume that the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions at the largest amount deemed more likely than not will be realized upon tax examination. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as necessary.  Capitalized Software Costs  We capitalize certain software development costs under accounting frameworks that differ based on the nature of the software.  Capitalization of software development costs for software that is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. The establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs requires considerable judgment by us with respect to certain factors, including, but not limited to, determining which projects and development activities within those projects qualify for capitalization, anticipated future revenues, estimated economic life, and changes in software and hardware technologies. Amortization of capitalized costs commence on the date of general release of the software using the greater of the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, or the ratio of revenue in the period to total expected revenues over the products expected useful life. Capitalized software development costs are normally amortized over an estimated useful life of 5 years once the product has been released for customer use. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized  3.0 million,  3.0 million and  3.7 million, respectively, and recorded amortization expense of  4.8 million,  4.0 million and  3.8 million, respectively, of software development costs, excluding software developed for internal use. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying value of capitalized software costs, excluding software developed for internal use, was  10.4 million and  12.2 million, respectively.  We capitalize certain development costs associated with internal use software incurred during the application development stage. We expense costs associated with preliminary project phase activities, training, maintenance and any post-implementation costs as incurred. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized  14.0 million,  11.9 million and  10.4 million, respectively, of internal use software development costs associated with our SaaS-based technology platforms. Capitalized internal use software costs are normally amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years once the related project has been completed and deployed for use. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded amortization expense of  8.4 million,  7.2 million and  6.1 million, respectively, of capitalized internal use software costs associated with our SaaS-based technology platforms. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying value of capitalized internal use software associated with our SaaS-based technology platforms was  31.3 million and  25.7 million, respectively.

Results of Operations  Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020  Segment Information  Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer.  Our operating segments are organized principally by the type of product or service offered and by geography. Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments  Cloud Solutions, Banking Solutions, Payments and Documents and Other.  The following tables represent our segment revenues and our segment measure of profit  loss    Fiscal Year Ended  June 30, Increase  Decrease  Between Periods  2021 2020   Change Inc  Dec    Change Inc  Dec    Dollars in thousands   Segment revenue   Cloud Solutions   282,563   252,349   30,214 12.0    Banking Solutions 101,075 97,785 3,290 3.4    Payments and Documents 70,785 75,048  4,263   5.7     Other 16,980 17,039  59   0.3     Total segment revenue   471,403   442,221   29,182 6.6    Segment measure of profit   Cloud Solutions   58,604   54,002   4,602 8.5    Banking Solutions 3,575 4,849  1,274   26.3     Payments and Documents 17,126 19,336  2,210   11.4     Other  11,817   10,459   1,358  13.0    Total measure of segment profit   67,488   67,728    240   0.4     A reconciliation of the measure of total segment profit to our GAAP loss income before income taxes is as follows   Fiscal Year Ended  June 30,  2021 2020   in thousands   Total measure of segment profit   67,488   67,728  Less   Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets  21,173   20,370   Stock-based compensation plan expense  45,533   42,044   Acquisition and integration-related expenses  2,328   5,647   Restructuring expenses  4,244   1,652   Excess depreciation associated with restructuring events  633  -  Other non-core  expense  income  196  94  Global ERP system implementation and other costs -  485   Other expense, net of pension adjustments  3,843   5,025   Loss before income taxes    10,462     7,401   Cloud Solutions  Revenues from our Cloud Solutions segment increased  30.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due to increased revenue of  27.9 million from our payment platforms and  2.3 million from our legal spend management solutions. Segment profit increased  4.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of  7.2 million, primarily from subscription cost of revenues and increased operating expenses of  18.4 million primarily related to an increase in sales and marketing costs of  11.9 million, product development costs of  3.3 million, and general and administrative expenses of  3.2 million, as we continued to invest in new sales opportunities, product promotion and product innovation. We expect revenue and profit for the Cloud Solutions segment to increase in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily as a result of increased revenue from our payment platforms.  Banking Solutions  Revenues from our Banking Solutions segment increased  3.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased subscriptions revenue of  9.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in service and maintenance revenue and software licenses revenue of  5.9 million and  0.5 million, respectively. The increase in subscriptions revenue was primarily related to the expansion of our existing customer base on our SaaS banking platforms and as a result of our continued deployment of our newer banking solutions. The decrease in software licenses and service and maintenance  revenue was primarily driven by our focus on a subscription revenue model rather than one-time license events involving significant professional services. Segment profit decreased  1.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase in cost of revenues of  2.8 million and increases in product development and engineering costs of  1.3 million, general and administrative costs of  1.0 million, partially offset by a reduction in sales and marketing costs of  0.5 million We expect revenue to continue to increase and profit to remain relatively consistent for the Banking Solutions segment in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021.  Payments and Documents  Revenues from our Payments and Documents segment decreased  4.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to a decrease in service and maintenance revenue of  4.9 million, software licenses revenue of  2.0 million and other revenue of  0.9 million, partially offset by an increase in subscriptions revenue of  3.5 million. The decrease in software, service and maintenance and other revenue was driven by the continued conversion of our customer base and our sales focus for new customers to our hosted and subscription based solutions rather than deployed, perpetual license solutions. Segment profit decreased  2.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due to the revenue decrease described above and an increase in operating expenses of  0.9 million primarily related to increased sales and marketing costs of  0.6 million and product development costs of  0.3 million, partially offset by decreased cost of revenues of  3.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in service and maintenance costs of revenues of  2.6 million and other cost of revenues of  0.7 million, offset by a  0.4 million increase in subscription cost of revenues. We expect revenue to increase and profit to remain relatively consistent for the Payments and Documents segment in fiscal year 2022.  Other  Revenues from our Other segment remained consistent for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. However, the composition of revenue changed, with an increase in subscriptions revenue of  1.0 million, offset by decreases in software license revenue and services and maintenance revenue of  0.3 million and  0.8 million, respectively. Segment loss increased by  1.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The segment loss was attributable to the operations of the legacy fraud solutions sales channel we acquired and due to the impact of certain other centralized costs reported in this segment that are leveraged for our fraud solutions broadly. The increase in the segment loss was primarily due to an increase in cost of revenues of  0.5 million, primarily associated with increased subscriptions, and an increase in sales and marketing costs of  0.9 million. We expect Other segment revenue to remain consistent and profit to decrease slightly in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021.  Revenues by Category  Fiscal Year Ended  June 30, Increase  Decrease  Between Periods  2021 2020   Change Inc  Dec    Change Inc  Dec    Dollars in thousands   Revenues   Subscriptions   384,742   339,410   45,332 13.4    Software licenses 5,074 8,098  3,024   37.3     Service and maintenance 79,319 91,706  12,387   13.5     Other 2,268 3,007  739   24.6     Total revenues   471,403   442,221   29,182 6.6    Subscriptions  Revenues from subscriptions increased  45.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The overall revenue increase was primarily due to revenue increases in our Cloud Solutions segment, Banking Solutions segment and Payments and Documents segment of  31.2 million,  9.7 million and  3.5 million, respectively, primarily due to the growth in revenue from our payment platforms, the impact of new customers going live on our hosted platforms and the impact of existing customers converting to subscription based solutions. We expect subscriptions revenues to increase in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 due to revenue increases in our payment platforms, our banking solutions platforms and our legal spend management solutions.  Software Licenses  Revenues from software licenses decreased  3.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of decreased revenue from our Payment and Documents segment, Banking Solutions segment, and Other segment of  2.0 million,  0.5 million and  0.3 million, respectively. The decrease in software license revenue was anticipated and driven by the continued conversion of our customers to our hosted and subscription based solutions and our  continued de-emphasis of deployed, perpetual license solutions. We also believe that certain software buying decisions by our customers were delayed or deferred during fiscal year 2021 given the ongoing economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to continue to emphasize our hosted and subscription based solutions rather than on-premise software solutions in our on-going sales focus.  Service and Maintenance  Revenues from service and maintenance decreased  12.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year due to decreases in revenue from our Banking Solutions segment, Payments and Documents segment, Other segment and Cloud Solutions segment of  5.9 million,  4.9 million,  0.8 million and  0.8 million, respectively. The decreases reflect our continued emphasis on selling subscription based solutions rather than deployed, on-premise perpetual-license solutions. We expect service and maintenance revenues will decrease in fiscal year 2022 as a result of decreased services revenue from our Payments and Documents and Banking Solutions segments due to our continued emphasis on subscription and hosted solutions.  Other  Our other revenues consist principally of equipment and supplies sales, which remained minor components of our overall revenue. We expect that other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2022.  Cost of Revenues  Fiscal Year Ended  June 30, Increase  Decrease  Between Periods  2021 2020   Change Inc  Dec    Change Inc  Dec    Dollars in thousands   Cost of revenues   Subscriptions   153,308   136,417   16,891 12.4    Software licenses 412 528  116   22.0     Service and maintenance 41,154 49,955  8,801   17.6     Other 1,578 2,186  608   27.8     Total cost of revenues   196,452   189,086   7,366 3.9    Gross profit   274,951   253,135   21,816 8.6    Subscriptions  Subscriptions costs include salaries and other related costs for our professional services teams as well as costs related to our hosting infrastructure such as depreciation and facilities related expenses. Subscriptions costs as a percentage of subscriptions revenues remained consistent at 40  for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. We expect subscriptions costs as a percentage of subscriptions revenues will decrease in fiscal year 2022 as a result of increased revenue contribution from our SaaS solutions.  Software Licenses  Software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to distribute our software products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software that is incorporated into or sold with certain of our products. Software license costs remained consistent at 8  of software license revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 7  for the prior fiscal year. We expect software license costs as a percentage of software license revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2022.  Service and Maintenance  Service and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and help desk support staffs, as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team. Service and maintenance costs decreased to 52  of service and maintenance revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 54  of service and maintenance revenues for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenue reflects the continued shift to hosted solutions rather than on-premise, perpetual license solutions. We expect that service and maintenance costs as a percentage of service and maintenance revenues will increase in fiscal year 2022.  Other  Other costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell, as well as freight, shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products. These remain minor components of our business. We expect other costs as a percentage of other revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal year 2022.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by  13.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to an increase in employee related costs of  15.0 million, partially offset by decreased travel costs as a result of COVID related travel restrictions of  2.6 million. We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue to increase modestly in fiscal year 2022.  Product Development and Engineering  Product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development, which consists of enhancements and revisions to our products as well as initiatives related to new product development. Product development and engineering expenses increased by  5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in headcount related costs of  5.0 million as we continued to invest in the deployment of innovative, feature-rich products. We expect product development and engineering expenses as a percentage of total revenues will increase modestly in fiscal year 2022.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses increased by  6.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased employee related costs of  6.7 million, depreciation expense of  2.0 million, and restructuring costs of  3.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition and integration expense of  3.0 million and facility costs of  2.1 million. We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will remain consistent in fiscal year 2022.  Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets  We amortize our acquired intangible assets in proportion to the estimated rate at which the asset provides economic benefit to us. Accordingly, amortization expense rates are often higher in the earlier periods of an assets estimated life. The increase in amortization expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to the impact of fiscal year 2021 acquisitions We expect that total amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for fiscal year 2022 will be approximately  20.5 million.

Interest expense increased by  0.8 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting the higher outstanding balance under our line of credit for the first half of fiscal 2021. Other income increased by  2.2 million in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to the absence of a   1.0 million settlement accounting charge we recorded in fiscal 2020 associated with our Swiss defined benefit pension plan and the presence in fiscal 2021 of approximately  1.0 million in other income associated with fair value adjustments for certain equity investments we hold.  Provision for Income Taxes  We recorded an income tax expense of  5.8 million and  1.8 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The income tax expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was due to income tax expense relating to our U.K. and Swiss operations. We also recorded income tax expense of  2.1 million relating to tax legislation in the U.K. that was enacted during fiscal year 2021 which provides for the increase in the U.K. tax rate to 25  beginning April 1, 2023. These amounts were offset in part by an income tax benefit relating to our U.S. operations. The income tax expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was due to income tax expense relating to our U.S., U.K. and Swiss operations, offset in part by an income tax benefit relating to our Israeli operations, and by an income tax benefit of  0.3 million relating to the enactment in the U.S. of the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act  CARES ACT .

Segment profit increased  0.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the revenue increase described above, partially offset by increased cost of revenues from subscriptions of  7.1 million and increased operating expenses of  13.0 million primarily related to increased sales and marketing costs as we continued to invest in new sales opportunities, product promotion and product innovation.  Banking Solutions  Revenues from our Banking Solutions segment increased  3.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due to increased subscriptions revenue of  12.5 million as we continued to expand the base of customers on our SaaS platforms and as a result of our continued deployment of our newer banking solutions, partially offset by a decrease in our software license revenue of  4.0 million and decreased professional services and maintenance revenue of  4.6 million. Segment profit decreased  3.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased sales and marketing and product development and engineering costs of  2.7 million and  2.4 million, respectively.  Payments and Documents  Revenues from our Payments and Documents segment decreased  2.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to a decrease in service and maintenance revenue of  4.0 million and a decrease in software license revenue of  2.3 million, partially offset by an increase in subscriptions revenue of  4.5 million. The decrease in service and maintenance revenue was driven by the continued conversion of our customers to our hosted and subscription based solutions rather than deployed, perpetual license solutions. Segment profit decreased  1.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to the revenue decrease described above, partially offset by decreased operating expenses of  0.5 million related to general and administrative expenses.  Other  Revenues from our Other segment decreased by  1.5 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. Segment loss increased by  5.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The revenue decrease was due primarily to decreases in software licenses revenue of  1.1 million, service and maintenance revenue of  0.8 million and other revenue of  0.6 million, partially offset by an increase in subscriptions revenue of  1.0 million. The segment loss was attributable to the operations of the legacy fraud solutions sales channel we acquired and due to the impact of certain other centralized costs reported in this segment that are leveraged for our fraud solutions broadly. The increase in the segment loss was primarily due to the revenue decreases in addition to increased service and maintenance cost of revenue of  1.9 million and increased product development costs of  1.7 million.

The overall revenue increase was primarily due to revenue increases from our Cloud Solutions segment, Banking Solutions segment and Payments and Documents segment of  25.8 million,  12.5 million and  4.5 million, respectively, primarily due to the impact of customers going live on our hosted platforms and the impact of customers converting to subscription based solutions.  Software Licenses  Revenues from software licenses decreased  8.3 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily as a result of decreased revenue from our Banking Solutions segment, Payments and Documents segment and Other segment of  4.1 million,  2.3 million and  1.1 million, respectively. The decrease in software license revenue was  predominantly by design and driven by the evolution of our business strategy, which is focused on a subscription revenue model rather than one-time license events. We also believe that certain software buying decisions by our customers were delayed or deferred in the latter part of fiscal year 2020 given the ongoing economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Service and Maintenance  Revenues from service and maintenance decreased  14.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year due to decreases in revenue from our Payments and Documents segment of  4.0 million, Banking Solutions segment of  4.6 million and Cloud Solutions segment of  4.8 million. The decreases reflect our continued emphasis on selling subscription based solutions rather than deployed, perpetual-license solutions.  Other  Our other revenues consist principally of equipment and supplies sales, which remained minor components of our overall revenue.

Subscriptions costs as a percentage of subscriptions revenues decreased to 40  for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to 43  for the prior fiscal year, driven by the revenue increases in our banking, legal spend management and payment platforms.  Software Licenses  Software license costs consist of expenses incurred by us to distribute our software products and related documentation and costs of licensing third party software that is incorporated into or sold with certain of our products. Software license costs were consistent at 7  of software license revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to 6  for the prior fiscal year.  Service and Maintenance  Service and maintenance costs include salaries and other related costs for our customer service, maintenance and help desk support staffs, as well as third party contractor expenses used to complement our professional services team. Service and maintenance costs increased to 54  of service and maintenance revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to 48  of service and maintenance revenues for the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased service and maintenance costs from our legacy payments and documents solutions.  Other  Other costs include the costs associated with equipment and supplies that we resell, as well as freight, shipping and postage costs associated with the delivery of our products.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by  11.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to an increase in employee related costs of  8.6 million and increased marketing related expenses of  1.6 million incurred to support our continued revenue growth and the global marketing of our products.  Product Development and Engineering  Product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of personnel costs to support product development, which consists of enhancements and revisions to our products. Product development and engineering expenses increased by  5.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as a result of an increase in headcount related costs as we continued to invest in the deployment of innovative, feature-rich products.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses increased by  4.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due primarily to increased employee related costs of  5.0 million and acquisition related costs of  2.0 million, partially offset by decreased global enterprise resource planning  ERP  implementation and other costs of  3.0 million.  Amortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets  We amortize our acquired intangible assets in proportion to the estimated rate at which the asset provides economic benefit to us. Accordingly, amortization expense rates are often higher in the earlier periods of an assets estimated life. The decrease in amortization expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year occurred as a result of amortization rates decreasing over the underlying asset lives.

Provision for Income Taxes  We recorded income tax expense of  1.8 million and an income tax benefit of  2.5 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The income tax expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was due to income tax expense relating to our U.S., U.K. and Swiss operations, offset in part by an income tax benefit relating to our Israeli operations and by an  income tax benefit of  0.3 million relating to the enactment in the U.S. of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act  CARES Act . The income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 was due to income tax benefits relating to our U.S. and Israeli operations, offset in part by income tax expense in our UK and Swiss operations. The income tax benefit in the U.S. was related to a reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities and a reduction to our valuation allowance arising from our acquisition of BankSight Software Systems, Inc. where certain deferred tax liabilities provide a source of future taxable income. We also recorded a discrete tax benefit of  0.8 million from the enactment of legislation that decreased tax rates in Switzerland.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We are party to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders that provides for a credit facility in the amount of up to  300 million  the Credit Facility . We have the right to request an increase to the aggregate commitments to the Credit Facility of up to  150 million, subject to specified conditions. The Credit Facility expires in July 2023. At June 30, 2021, borrowings were  130 million and we were in compliance with all covenants associated with the Credit Facility.  We have financed our operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities, the sale of our common stock and debt proceeds. We have historically generated strong positive operating cash flows. We believe that the cash generated from our operations and the cash and cash equivalents we have on hand will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future. If our existing cash resources along with cash generated from operations and cash that we have access to through our Credit Facility is insufficient to satisfy our operating requirements, we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek other financing arrangements.  One of our financial goals is to maintain and improve our capital structure. The key metrics we focus on in assessing the strength of our liquidity and a summary of our cash activity for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 are summarized in the tables below   June 30, June 30,  2021 2020   in thousands   Cash and cash equivalents   133,932   194,832  Marketable securities 10,216 10,209  Borrowings under credit facility 130,000 180,000  Fiscal Year Ended  June 30,  2021 2020   in thousands   Cash provided by operating activities 76,116 97,171  Cash used in investing activities  83,986   47,530   Cash  used in  provided by financing activities  56,166  54,624  Effect of exchange rates on cash 6,668  930   Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. At June 30, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents of  133.9 million consisted primarily of cash deposits held at major banks and money market funds. The  60.9 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 from June 30, 2020 was primarily due to cash used to fund  the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of  50 million, the repurchases of our common stock of  10.8 million, capital expenditures, including capitalization of software costs of  31.9 million, business and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired of  41.3 million and other investment opportunities of  10.9 million, partially offset by cash generated from operations of  76.1 million and the effect of foreign exchange rates on cash of  6.7 million.  At June 30, 2021, our marketable securities of  10.2 million consisted of U.S. government debt securities.  Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included approximately  59.9 million held by our foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2021. We repatriated  25.5 million and  10.0 million from our U.K. subsidiary during the fiscal years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We continue to permanently reinvest the earnings, if any, of our international subsidiaries other than the U.K., Switzerland, India and one of our Australian subsidiaries; therefore we do not provide for U.S. income taxes that could result from the distribution of foreign earnings from our subsidiaries other than those aforementioned. If our reinvestment plans were to change based on future events and we decided to repatriate amounts from other international subsidiaries, those amounts would generally become subject to U.S. state tax to the extent there were cumulative profits in the foreign subsidiary from which the distribution to the U.S. was made, and we could be further subject to withholding taxes.  Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars. Increases primarily in the foreign currency exchange rate of the British Pound Sterling to the U.S. Dollar increased our overall cash balances  by approximately  6.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Further changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the British Pound Sterling and other currencies could have a significant effect on our overall cash balances, however, we continue to believe that our existing cash balances, even in light of the foreign currency volatility we frequently experience, are adequate to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.  Operating Activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income or loss for non-cash operating items, such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation plan expense, deferred income tax benefits or expenses, and impairment charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in our results of operations. Cash generated from operations decreased by  21.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in cash flows generated from the change in accounts receivable of  4.5 million, an increase in cash flows used for prepaid expensed and other current assets and other assets of  8.7 million, and accounts payable and accrued expenses of  9.9 million.  Investing Activities. Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, inclusive of capitalized software costs, investment purchases and sales and cash used for the acquisition of businesses and assets. The  36.5 million increase in net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to cash used to fund business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of  41.3 million and other investments of  9.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures of  14.8 million.  Financing Activities. Financing cash flows consist primarily of cash inflows as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock through employee equity incentive plans, offset by repurchases of our common stock. The increase in cash used in financing activities of  110.8 million was due to an increase in cash used to repay amounts due under our revolving credit facility of  40 million and the absence of borrowing under our revolving credit facility of  80 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock of  8.4 million.  Contractual Obligations  Following is a summary of future payments that we are required to make under existing contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021   Payment Due by Fiscal Year  2022 2023-2024 2025-2026 Thereafter Total   in thousands   Credit Facility  Principal payment   -   130,000   -   -   130,000  Interest payments  1   3,169 3,346 - - 6,515  Commitment fee  2   298 309 - - 607  Operating leases 7,656 9,862 6,525 19,079 43,122  Purchase commitments 13,529 7,470 794 - 21,793  Total contractual obligations   24,652   150,987   7,319   19,079   202,037  ------   1 The Credit Facility carries a variable rate of interest. Interest payments were estimated using the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2021 net of the impact of interest rate swaps we have in place.   2 The Credit Facility agreement includes a commitment fee, which we have included in the table above, based on the applicable interest rate as of June 30, 2021 and our remaining borrowing capacity of  170 million.  Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including  fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. In addition to the base terms, we have certain options to extend the terms of our agreements. Payments are fixed for the initial terms and are subject to increase in the event that we elect to extend the service. Obligations under contract that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.  Our estimate of unrecognized tax benefits for which cash settlement may be required, in the amount of  2.2 million, has been excluded from the table above. These amounts have been excluded because, as of June 30, 2021, we are unable to estimate the timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with these liabilities as we do not currently anticipate settling any of these tax positions with cash payment in the foreseeable future.  The contractual obligations table above also excludes our estimate of the contributions we will make to our Swiss defined benefit pension plan in fiscal year 2022, which is  2.1 million based on foreign exchange rates in effect on June 30, 2021. We have not disclosed contributions for periods after fiscal year 2022, as those amounts are subject to future changes. We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021."}

The number of patents licensed, and therefore the cost of the patent license to the customer, will depend upon which of the patents are used in a particular product or service. These licenses will typically include an initial license fee, as well as an ongoing royalty.  Our employees include the core development team behind our patent portfolio, technology, and software. Some members of this team have worked together for over twenty years and were on same team that invented and developed this technology while working at Leidos, Inc.  Leidos . The team has continued its research and development work and expanded the set of patents we acquired in 2006 from Leidos, into a larger patent portfolio. This portfolio now serves as the foundation of our products, services, and our licensing business. It is expected to generate most of our future revenue in license fees and royalties. We intend to continue our efforts to develop new products and technologies and further strengthen and expand our patent portfolio. We intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by, for example, offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents.  Index  Industry Overview    Trends  We believe that the rapid growth in remote work has accelerated digital business transformation initiatives that would have taken years, into a matter of months. The demand to work remotely, explosive growth of video conferencing tools and rapid growth in the cloud has created an opportunity to secure communications regardless of a users location, network, or BYOD  bring your own device .  The shift to remote work and expansion of the enterprise network perimeter has driven the growth of ZTNA solutions. The Zero Trust concept treats all networks like the Internet, where all users and devices are untrusted by default. Their location within the network is not a factor for deciding trust. Each user and device on the network require authentication and authorization, based on policy, prior to accessing any applications or resources on the network. ZTNA facilitates security around remote work, because Zero Trust policies enable granular access control, end-to-end encryption of network communications and remove application visibility from the public Internet reducing the attack surface. Based on our research and estimates, we believe that the Zero-Trust Security Market size is projected to grow from USD 15.6 billion in 2019 to USD 38.6 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate  CAGR  of 19.9  from 2019 to 2024. We believe Zero Trust represents a growing market and an ideal fit for our technology and products.  With large portions of the global population now living under some form of lockdown, the global coronavirus pandemic has forced many organizations to shift their business processes - and their employees are having to embrace a work-from-home culture on a scale never attempted. Remote work has accelerated the adoption of video conferencing and meeting applications across all industries making it an essential tool to connect with remote customers, workforces, and employees to prevent direct contact. Based on our estimates, we believe that the worldwide Video Conferencing Market size is projected to grow from USD 14 billion in 2019 to USD 35 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 16.5  from 2020 to 2026. This rapid adoption, learning curve and demand to continue working remotely has created significant security concerns and breaches for enterprises. Our market research has focused on security conscious verticals such as healthcare, banking, legal and government where security breaches can significantly impact outcomes. In many cases, these enterprises adopted industry standard video conferencing tools and are now looking at more secure alternative solutions. Enterprises want video conferencing solutions that protect their information and allow them greater security control and visibility, while continuing to be reliable, easy to use and cost effective. Enterprises in these verticals are also looking for video conferencing solutions that integrate into their existing workflows and better align with specific use cases instead of forcing them to adapt to more one size fits all solutions on the market. We believe our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite represents a starting point to offer secure video conferencing tools built on a zero-trust architecture.  Cloud computing growth has rapidly expanded as enterprises continue to move applications and services to the cloud. The cloud offers scalability, operations and development efficiency and remote access benefits for their workforce. Based on our estimates, we believe that the global cloud computing market size is expected to grow from approximately USD 293 billion in 2020 to over USD 810 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 18.5  during the forecast period. The cloud technology adoption is expected to increase quite significantly in industries where the Work-From-Home  WFH  initiative is helping to sustain enterprise business functions. However, shifting critical data to the cloud has resulted in security concerns and the need for enterprises to control access and gain visibility into how information is being used, who is accessing it and where it is going. We believe our scalable technology allows enterprises to secure applications and services regardless of whether hosting is on-premise or in the cloud.  As billions of connected Internet of Things  IoT  devices come online in support of enterprise operations, products, and industrial controls they will need to be secured and integrated into the enterprise. Facilitated by advancements in 4G Advanced LTE and high-speed 5G networks, IoT devices will be able to operate from any network, transmit higher volumes of data including video streaming and sensor data collection and require real-time decisions based on that data. Without next generation security, these IoT devices represent a large attack surface that manages and control critical enterprise infrastructure. These IoT devices can operate from anywhere, will need to be secured with the same level of network security and ZTNA solutions enterprises are already deploying for their remote workforce. We believe that the market opportunity for our software and technology solutions is large and expanding as secure domain names are now an integral part of securing the next generation 5G and 4G LTE Advanced wireless networks and IoT communications in areas including Smart City, Connected Car and Connected Home. Based on our estimates, we believe that the size of global Industrial Internet of Things  IIoT  market is projected to grow from USD 83.6 billion in 2020 to approximately USD 254 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 20.35  during this forecasted period with a growing investment in securing the infrastructure around these devices.  Index  Our Approach   Strategy  Our portfolio of intellectual property is the foundation of our business model. We currently own approximately 194 total patents and pending applications, including 70 U.S. patents patent applications and 124 foreign patents validations pending applications. This portfolio now serves as the foundation of our products, services, and our licensing business. It is expected to generate the majority of our future revenue in license fees and royalties.  Our strategy is to become the market leader in securing real-time communications over the Internet and to establish our GABRIEL Connection Technology as the industry standard security platform. Key elements of our strategy are to    Actively recruit partners in various vertical markets, including healthcare, finance, legal, government to help us rapidly expand our enterprise customer base.   Continue to grow our technology licensing program to commercialize our intellectual property, including our GABRIEL Connection Technology.   Promote our Gabriel Secure Communication Platform as a solution for delivering ZTNA.   Grow our GABRIEL Gateway product offering to secure enterprise applications, services, and infrastructure.   Grow registration of GABRIEL Secure Domains as the network segmentation component of our ZTNA solution. Establish VirnetX as the exclusive, universal registry of secure domain names and enable our customers to act as registrars for their users and broker secure communication between devices.   Promote Gabriel Collaboration Suite products in the general market for sale to end-user enterprises, directly and with partners, with targeted promotions and other marketing programs. Expand GABRIEL Collaboration Suite to include video conferencing to assist remote workers and offer an industry leading secure meeting solution.  GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform delivers ZTNA allowing enterprises to secure their information, control access and gain visibility into how information is being used, who is accessing it and where it is going. Our patented technology allows enterprises to license our technology for integration into their products and services, easily deploy our technology through our GABRIEL Gateway product for endpoint security or securing their communications with our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite application.  We believe GABRIEL Gateway will support enterprises in securing their networks as their applications, services, virtualized resources, and data moves to the cloud. GABRIEL Gateway secures applications, services and infrastructure using ZTNA. Enterprises can quickly deploy GABRIEL Gateway to protect legacy applications, secure new cloud-based services and remove application visibility from the public Internet. Enterprises can move towards more granular network access control to protect their network at the edge and away from legacy VPN technologies. GABRIEL Gateway enables remote employees to securely communication with on-premise and cloud-based applications, regardless of their location. GABRIEL Gateway is included with the GABRIEL Collaboration Suite and offered as a separate licensing program for enterprises that need a Gateway only solution. Enterprises can also use GABRIEL Gateway to secure open-source applications powering communications, data and analytics, infrastructure, and business services with a focus on making those applications easier to secure, access and manage.  GABRIEL Secure Domains provide two fundamental capabilities for enterprises to manage device security and access control.   Unique, certificate-based device identities, tied to a user, that are used to authenticate and authorize device access  e.g., GABRIEL Connection Technology , based on a set of policies.   Flexible, software-based network segmentation that enterprises can deploy on-demand, without requiring additional hardware infrastructure.  Enterprise customers understand the complexity of device certificate management at scale, the operational costs and security ramifications, if not done properly. GABRIEL Secure Domains enable certificate-based identities and when used within the GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform, provides a cloud-based service that automates the process of issuing, renewing, and revoking device certificates across the enterprise at scale. With GABRIEL Secure Domains, enterprises have a solution for managing device security and access control driven by the rapid growth of IoT and remote work.  Each GABRIEL Secure Domain creates a network microsegment or secure enclave that includes a set of resources  e.g., applications, services, or data  and a set of users and devices an enterprise can assign to access those resources. Used within the GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform, enterprises can scale and adapt their network architecture, on-demand, based on business and workforce needs. Enterprises see the power of GABRIEL Secure Domains as a way to flexibility segment their networks, enforce access policies, audit compliance, isolate and limit lateral network movement, secure and limit access for remote workers and gain access control and visibility into their network.  Index  We believe GABRIEL Collaboration Suite provides the foundation for real-time, secure communications and collaboration applications for the enterprise remote workforce. We bundle multiple applications together within the GABRIEL Collaboration Suite, including Secure Chat, Secure Share, Secure Video Voice, Secure Mail, Secure Backup Sync and GABRIEL Gateway. We are exploring unbundling the applications within GABRIEL Collaboration Suite and offering  la carte product options. This approach allows us to offer more flexible licensing options to solve specific customer use-cases, align with partner product offerings and create upsell opportunities.

Index  Intellectual Property and Patent Rights  Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, patented know-how, issued and pending patents, copyrights and technological innovation.  We currently own approximately 194 total patents and pending applications, including 70 U.S. patents patent applications and 124 foreign patents validations pending applications. Our portfolio includes a number of patents that describe unique systems and methods for securing real-time communications over the Internet, as well as related services such as the establishment and maintenance of a secure domain name registry. Our software and technology solutions also may have additional applications relating to operating systems and network security. A complete list of our U.S. patents is available on our website located at www.virnetx.com. Each patent is publicly accessible on the Internet website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at www.uspto.gov. The term of each of our issued U.S. and foreign patents will expire during the period from 2020 to 2024.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that might incorporate future filings, the information set forth on the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO Website, shall not be deemed to be a part of or incorporated by reference into any such filings. The Company does not warrant the accuracy, or completeness or adequacy of the USPTO Website, and expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions on such website.  Assignment of Patents  Some of our issued patents and pending patent applications were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary, VirnetX, Inc., from Leidos, pursuant to an Assignment Agreement dated December 21, 2006, and a Patent License and Assignment Agreement dated August 12, 2005, as amended on November 2, 2006, including documents prepared pursuant to the November amendment, and as further amended on March 12, 2008. We recorded the assignment from Leidos, with the U.S. Patent Office on December 21, 2006.  Key terms of these agreements are as follows    Patent Assignment. Leidos, unconditionally and irrevocably conveyed, transferred, assigned, and quitclaimed all its right, title, and interest in and to the patents and patent applications, as specifically set forth on Exhibit A to the assignment document recorded with the U.S. Patent Office, including, without limitation, the right to sue for past infringement.   License to Leidos, Outside the Field of Use. Effective March 12, 2008, we granted to Leidos, a non-exclusive, royalty free, fully paid, perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, sub licensable and transferable right and license permitting Leidos, and its assignees to make, have made, import, use, offer for sale, and sell products and services covered by, and to make improvements to, the patents and patent applications we acquired from Leidos, solely outside our field of use.   Compensation Obligations. As consideration for the assignment of the patents and for the rights we obtained from Leidos, as amended, we are required to make payments to Leidos, based on cash or certain other values generated from those patents. The amount of such payments depends upon the type of value generated, and certain categories are subject to maximums and other limitations. In 2010, we met our maximum royalty payment requirement; however, Leidos is also entitled under certain circumstances to receive a portion of the proceeds paid to us for certain acquisitions of VirnetX and the settlement of certain patent infringement claims of ours.  Government Regulation  The laws governing online secure communications remain largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been legislative action. It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property, privacy, data protection and libel apply to online communications and media. Such legislation may interfere with the growth in use of online secure communications and decrease the acceptance of online secure communications as a viable solution, which could adversely affect our business.  Due to the Internets popularity and increasing use, new laws regulating secure communications may be adopted. These laws and regulations may cover, among other things, issues relating to privacy, data protection, pricing, taxation, telecommunications over the Internet, content, copyrights, distribution and quality of products and services. We intend to comply with all new laws and regulations as they are adopted.  The U.S. government has controlled the authoritative domain name system, or DNS, root server since the inception of the Internet. On July 1, 1997, the President of the United States directed the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to privatize the management of the domain name system in a manner that increases competition and facilitates international participation in its management.  Index  On September 29, 2006, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended its delegation of authority by entering into a new agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, a California non-profit corporation headquartered in Marina Del Rey, California. ICANN is responsible for managing the accreditation of registry providers and registrars that manage the assignment of top-level domain names associated with the authoritative DNS root directory. Although it is possible to create and manage other DNS root directories privately without accreditation from ICANN, the possibility of conflicting name and number assignments makes it less likely that users would widely adopt a top-level domain name associated with an alternative DNS root directory provided by a non-ICANN-accredited registry service.  Employees  On December 31, 2020, the Company had 21 full and part time employees, most of whom work remotely from our corporate offices. The Company has had an at-home work force since its inception. The emphasis of our employees is on our technology research and product development with 11 employees focused on this effort. The team has been working on enhancing our products and adding new functionality along with successfully filing several new patent applications in 2021. We also continue building our sales and marketing teams to expand our product-lines and customer base. In 2021 we added a Chief Operating Officer for our subsidiary in Japan who will be focused on growing our market and products in that region.  In addition to our regular employees, we also engage with important consultants on a regular basis. These consultants can be involved in our product development, customer relations, legal, and or regulatory compliance and reporting. The Company has experienced low employee turnover rates over the years with both employees and some consultants participating in our incentive stock option RSU plans.

{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making any investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of these risk factors occur, you could lose substantial value or your entire investment in our shares.  Risks Related to Our Business and Our Financial Reporting  We are involved and will continue to be involved in litigation defending our patent portfolio, which can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot anticipate the results.  We spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue our current litigation. We believe that this litigation and others that we may pursue in the future could continue for years and consume significant financial and management resources. The counterparties to our litigation include large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than us. Patent litigation is risky, and the outcome is uncertain, and we cannot assure you that any of our current or future litigation matters will result in a favorable outcome for us. In addition, even if we obtain favorable interim rulings or verdicts, they may be inconsistent with the ultimate resolution of the dispute. Also, we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to claims or sanctions against us which may be costly or impossible for us to defend. Unfavorable or adverse outcomes may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects, which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize our products.  Index  We may not be able to capitalize on market opportunities related to our licensing strategy or our patent portfolio.  Our business strategy includes licensing our patents and technology to other companies in order to reach a larger end-user base than we could reach through direct sales and marketing efforts; as such, our business strategy and revenues may depend on intellectual property licensing fees and royalties for the majority of our revenues. We currently derive minimal revenue from licensing activities, and royalties, and we cannot assure you that we will successfully capitalize on our market opportunities or that our current business strategy will succeed.  Although to date we have entered into a limited number of settlement and license agreements, we may not be successful in entering into further licensing relationships, or if we are successful in entering into such relationships, the acquisition of them may be expensive, and they, as well as our existing settlement and our existing and pending license agreements may not generate the financial results, we expect.  Factors that may affect our ability to execute our current business strategy include, but are not limited to, the following    Third parties may challenge the validity of our patents;   The pendency of our various litigations may cause potential licensees not to do business with us;   Our patents may expire before we can make our business strategy successful;   We face, and we expect to continue to face, intense competition from new and established competitors who may have superior products and services or better marketing, financial or other capacities than we do; and   It is possible that one or more of our potential customers or licensees develops or otherwise sources products or technologies similar to, competitive with or superior to ours.  If we are not able to adequately protect our patent rights, our business would be negatively impacted.  We believe our patents are valid, enforceable, and valuable. Notwithstanding this belief, third parties may make claims of infringement or invalidity claims with respect to our patents and such claims could give rise to material cost for defense or settlement or both, jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome of litigation we are or may become involved in, divert resources away from our other activities, limit or cease our revenues related to such patents, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business. Similar challenges could also prevent us from obtaining additional patents in the future. Additionally, several of our patents are currently, and other patents may in the future be, subject to United States Patent and Trademark Office  USPTO  post-grant inter partes review proceedings  IPR  which may result in all or part of these patents being invalidated, or the claims of our patents being limited. Unfavorable or adverse outcomes in our litigation or IPRs may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources, reduction in our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights, or other adverse effects, which could encumber our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Even if we are successful in enforcing our intellectual property rights, our patents may not ultimately provide us with any competitive advantages and may be less valuable than we currently expect. These risks may be heightened in countries other than the United States where laws regarding patent protection are less developed, and may be negatively affected by the fact that legal standards in the United States and elsewhere for protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related businesses are uncertain and still evolving. In addition, there are a significant number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest, and we expect that significant litigation in these areas will continue and will add uncertainty to the value of certain patents and other intellectual property rights in our areas of interest. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or otherwise realize value from them, our business would be negatively affected.  Index  We can provide no assurances that the licensing of our essential security patents under FRAND will be successful.  At the request of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute  ETSI , and the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions  ATIS , we agreed to update our licensing declaration to ETSI and ATIS under their respective Intellectual Property Rights policies. This was in response to our Statement of Patent Holder identifying a group of our patents and patent applications that we believe are or may become essential to certain developing specifications in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution  LTE , Systems Architecture Evolution project. We will make available a non-exclusive patent license under FRAND  fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and conditions, with compensation  for the patents identified by us that are or become essential to applicants desiring to implement the Technical Specifications identified by us, as set forth in the updated licensing declaration under the ATIS and ETSI Intellectual Property Rights policies. Our licensing declarations under the ATIS and ETSI Intellectual Property Rights policies may limit our flexibility in determining royalties and license terms for certain of our patents. Consequently, we cannot assure you that the licensing of the essential security patents will be successful or that third parties will be willing to enter into licenses with us on reasonable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our competitive position.  Because our business is conducted or expected to be conducted in an environment that is subject to rapid change, we may be subject to various developments in regulation, law, and consumer preferences to which we may not be able to adapt successfully.  The current regulatory environment for our products and services remains unclear. We can give no assurance that our planned product offerings will be in compliance with laws and regulations of local, state, United States federal or foreign authorities. Further, we can give no assurance that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or regulations or that such laws or regulations will not be modified, or that new laws or regulations will be enacted in the future which would cause us to be in violation of such laws or regulations. For example, Voice-Over-Internet Protocol  VoIP  services are not currently subject to all the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony, but it is possible that similar regulations may be applied to VoIP in the future and that these could result in substantial costs to us which could adversely affect the marketability of our products and planned products related to VoIP. For further example, the use of the Internet and private Internet Protocol  IP  networks for communication is largely unregulated within the United States, but may become regulated in the future; additionally, several foreign governments have enacted measures that could restrict or prohibit voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks.  Our business depends on the growth of instant messaging, VoIP, mobile services, streaming video, file transfer and remote desktop and other next-generation Internet-based applications. A decline in the use of these applications due to complexity or cost relative to alternate traditional or newly developed communications channels, or development of alternative technologies, could cause a material decline in the number of users in these areas.  More aggressive domestic or international regulation of the Internet in general, and Internet telephony providers and services specifically may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future prospects.  Our exposure to outside influences beyond our control, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement activities and results of operations.  Our licensing and enforcement activities are subject to numerous risks from outside influences, including the following    New legislation, regulations or rules related to obtaining patents or enforcing patents could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease our revenue. For instance, the United States Supreme Court has modified some tests used by the USPTO in granting patents during the past 20 years which may decrease the likelihood that we will be able to obtain patents and increase the likelihood of challenge of any patents we obtain or license. In addition, in 2012 the United States enacted sweeping changes to the United States patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that transition the United States from a first-to-invent system to a first to file system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents;   More patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO;  Index   Federal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer; and   As patent enforcement becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for us to voluntarily license our patents.  New legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm our business and operating results.  Intellectual property is the subject of intense scrutiny by the courts, legislatures, and executive branches of governments around the world. Various patent offices, governments or intergovernmental bodies may implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process, or the rights of patent holders and such changes could negatively affect licensing efforts and or litigations. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect our ability to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights.  It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. We may need to raise additional capital to support our business growth, and this capital will be dilutive, may cause our stock price to drop or may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.  We may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available to us when needed or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances, including sales under our ATM or our universal shelf registration statement. Our ability to obtain additional capital, if and when required, will depend on our business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, the terms of our current contractual obligations and other factors. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, including those under our ATM or our Universal Shelf Registration Statement, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. Additionally, we are unable to predict the future success of our ATM or any other offering. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or other financings might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock, and could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. If we issue debt securities or incur indebtedness, we could experience increased future payment obligations and a need to comply with restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain additional capital or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms, our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or other circumstances could be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.  If we experience security breaches, we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer.  We expect to retain certain confidential and proprietary customer information in our secure data centers and secure domain name registry, as well as personal data and other confidential and proprietary information relating to our business. It will be critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Our secure domain name registry operations will also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption, and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system. The secure domain name servers that we will operate will be critical hardware to our registry services operations. Therefore, we expect to have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our products, facilities, and infrastructure. Security technologies are constantly being tested by computer professionals, academics and hackers. Advances in computer capabilities and the techniques for attacking security solutions, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security measures and could make some or all our products obsolete or unmarketable. Likewise, if any of our products are found to have significant security vulnerabilities, then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the vulnerabilities and to repair or replace products already sold or licensed to our customers. Despite the security measures that we and our service providers utilize, our infrastructure and that of our service providers may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, phishing attacks, social engineering, or similar disruptive problems. It is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems. The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing vulnerability to cyber-attacks, as more individuals and companies work online, which increases these risks. As a provider of Internet security software and technology, we may be the target of dedicated efforts by hackers and other third parties to overcome or defeat our security measures. Any physical or electronic break-in or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems, including any compromise due to human error or employee or contractor malfeasance, may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers. In such an event, we could face significant liability and current or potential customers could be reluctant to use our services. Additionally, any such data security incident, or the perception that one has occurred could also result in adverse publicity, harm to our reputation and competitive position, and therefore adversely affect the markets perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over IP networks as well as the security or reliability of our services.  Index  A security breach or other security incident could require a substantial level of financial resources to rectify and otherwise respond to, may be difficult to identify or address in a timely manner, and could result in claims, investigations, and inquires by private parties or governmental entities that may divert managements attention and require the expenditure of significant time and resources, and which may cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liability and related legal and other costs. Any actual or perceived security breach or other security incident may also harm our reputation and make it more difficult or impossible for us to successfully market to others. Any of the foregoing matters could harm our operating results and financial condition.  Privacy and data security concerns, and data collection and transfer restrictions and related domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.  Personal privacy, information security, and data protection are significant issues in the United States, Europe, and many other jurisdictions where we have operations or offer our products. The regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage and use of confidential and proprietary business information and personal data is rapidly evolving. The United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use and dissemination of data.  Further, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union  EU , where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, and security of data that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses.  We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the EU, and other jurisdictions. For example, the European Commission adopted a General Data Protection Regulation  the GDPR  that became fully effective on May 25, 2018, superseding prior EU data protection legislation, imposing more stringent EU data protection requirements, and providing for greater penalties for noncompliance. The United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act that substantially implements the GDPR. We are evaluating obligations imposed on us by the GDPR and we may be required to incur substantial expense in order to make significant changes to our product and business operations in connection with obtaining and maintaining compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation, such as the UK Data Protection Act, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and product sales. Additionally, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act  the CCPA  that, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA on our business or operations, but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act  CPRA , recently was certified by the California Secretary of State to appear on the ballot for the November 3, 2020 election. If this initiative is approved by California voters, the CPRA would significantly modify the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs. More generally, we cannot yet fully determine the impact these or future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often subject to differing interpretations, may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, and may be alleged to be inconsistent with our current or future practices. Additionally, we may be bound by contractual requirements applicable to our collection, use, processing, and disclosure of various types of data, including personal data, and may be bound by, or voluntarily comply with, self-regulatory or other industry standards relating to these matters. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our products, increase our costs, impair our ability to grow our business, or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our service in some locations and may subject us to liability. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations may adversely affect our business. Further, in view of new or modified federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, or any changes in their interpretation, we may find it necessary or desirable to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our product and otherwise adapt to these changes. We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and features could be limited.  Index  The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for any noncompliance. Privacy, information security, and data protection concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.  We expect that we will experience long and unpredictable sales cycles, which may impact our operating results.  The sales cycle between initial customer contact and execution of a contract or license agreement with a customer or purchaser of our products can vary widely. We expect that our sales cycles will be long and unpredictable due to several factors, including but not limited to    The need to educate potential customers about our patent rights and our product and service capabilities;   The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our potential customers and their business operations, including their budgetary constraints and resources devoted to adopting new products.   Our customers willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products;   Our customers budgetary constraints;   The timing of our customers budget cycles;   Delays caused by customers internal review processes; and   Long sales cycles that may increase the risk that our financial resources are exhausted before we are able to generate significant revenue.  In addition, potential customers of our products include local, state, federal and foreign government authorities. Sales to government authorities can be extended and unpredictable. Government authorities generally have complex budgeting, purchasing, and regulatory processes that govern their capital spending, and their spending is likely to be adversely impacted by economic conditions, including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in many instances, sales to government authorities may require field trials and may be delayed by the time it takes for government officials to evaluate multiple competing bids, negotiate terms, and award contracts.  For these reasons, the sales cycle associated with our products is subject to a number of significant risks that are beyond our control. Consequently, if our forecasted customer orders are not realized or delayed, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  If we are unable to expand our revenue sources or establish, sustain, grow, or replace relationships with a diversified customer base, our revenues may be limited.  We currently generate revenue from a limited number of customers that have entered settlement and license agreements. Our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite is currently generating limited revenue, and it will take time for us to grow our installed user base and generate new customers. Additionally, there is no guarantee that we will be able to derive revenue from new customers, sustain or increase revenue from existing customers or replace customers from whom we currently generate revenue. As a result, our revenue may be limited or static.  Index  We have limited technical resources and are at an early stage in commercialization of our GABRIEL products.  Part of our business includes the internal development of commercial products we seek to monetize. This aspect of our business may require significant capital, time and resources and we cannot guarantee that it will be successful or meet our expectations. As such, we have a small technical team, which may limit our ability to rapidly adapt our product to customer requirements or add new product features to maintain our competitive edge and drive adoption. Based on the scale of our technical resources, our limited historical financial data upon which to base our projected revenue or planned operating expenses related to our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite, we may not be able to effectively    Generate revenues or profit from product sales;   Drive adoption of our products;   Attract and retain customers for our products;   Provide appropriate levels of customer training and support for our products;   Implement an effective marketing strategy to promote awareness of our products;   Focus our research and development efforts in areas that generate returns on our efforts;   Anticipate and adapt to changes in our market; or   Protect our products from any system failures or other breaches.  In addition, a high percentage of our expenses are and will continue to be fixed. Accordingly, if we do not generate revenue as and when anticipated, our losses may be greater than expected and our operating results will suffer.  Our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business.  Our products are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors or defects. Despite testing, some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers. Any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, we could face claims for product liability, tort, or breach of warranty, including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners. The performance of our products could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered as well as on third-party applications and services that utilize our services, which could result in legal claims against us, harming our business. Furthermore, we expect to provide implementation, consulting, and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products, which typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. We expect that our contracts with customers will contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations, which may not be upheld. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, is costly and may divert managements attention and adversely affect the markets perception of us and our products. In addition, if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely impacted.  Malfunctions of third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks that we cannot control.  Our business will depend upon, among other things, the capacity, reliability, security, and unimpeded access of the infrastructure owned by third parties that we will use to deploy our offerings. We have no control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment. We depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections. If one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future, our operations could be severely interrupted. Also, to the extent that the number of users of networks utilizing our current or future products suddenly increases, the technology platform and secure hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service interruptions. System interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time communications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners, and customers.  Index  System failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business.  The success of our license and service offerings will depend on the uninterrupted operation of various systems, secure data centers and other computer and communication networks that we establish. To the extent, the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases, the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times, service interruptions or delays or system failures. Our systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things    Power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures;   Damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, and other natural disasters;   Computer viruses or software defects; and   Physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.  System interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners, and customers.  Any significant problem with our systems or operations could result in lost revenue, customer dissatisfaction or lawsuits against us. A failure in the operation of our secure domain name registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain secure domain names for a period of time. A failure in the operation or update of the master directory that we plan to maintain could result in deletion or discontinuation of assigned secure domain names for a period of time. The inability of the registrar systems we establish, including our back-office billing and collections infrastructure, and telecommunications systems to meet the demands of an increasing number of secure domain name requests could result in substantial degradation in our customer support service and our ability to process registration requests in a timely manner.  Our ability to sell our solutions will be dependent on the quality of our technical support, and our failure to deliver high- quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.  If we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post- deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, or if potential customers perceive that we may not be able achieve to the foregoing, our ability to sell our products would be adversely affected, and our reputation with current and potential customers could be harmed. In addition, as we expand our operations internationally, our technical support team will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training, and documentation in languages other than English. Our failure to deliver and maintain high-quality technical support services to our customers could result in customers choosing to use our competitors products and support services instead of ours in the future.  Telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs, which, if granted, would increase the cost of online communication, and such increase in cost may impede the growth of online communication and adversely affect our business.  Index  Use of the Internet has over-burdened existing telecommunications infrastructures, and many high traffic areas have begun to experience interruptions in service. As a result, certain local telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs on IP telephony traffic that crosses over their traditional telephone networks. If the relief sought in these petitions is granted, the costs of communicating via online could increase substantially, potentially adversely affecting the growth in the use of online secure communications. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business.  The departure of Kendall Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and or other key personnel could compromise our ability to execute our strategic plan and materially harm our business.  Our success largely depends on the skills, experience, and performance of our key personnel. Due to the specialized nature of our business and limited staff, we are particularly dependent on Kendall Larsen, our Chief Executive Officer and President. We have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving us at any time. In addition, we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees. The loss of Mr. Larsen, or our failure to retain other key personnel or adequately plan for the succession of key personnel, would jeopardize our ability to execute our strategic plan and materially harm our business.  We will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business.  Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering, operations, marketing, sales and executive personnel. Inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business. Competition for engineering, operations, marketing, sales, and executive personnel is intense, particularly in the technology and Internet sectors and in the regions where we conduct our business. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Additionally, we can provide no assurance that we will attract or retain such personnel.  Our international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks, and our plans may not be successful.  We expect to expand our presence internationally in Japan and elsewhere through, third party arrangements such as international partnerships, joint ventures and potentially establishing international subsidiaries and offices. Our international expansion may present challenges and risks, including those inherent in international operations, to us and may require significant attention from management. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic could disrupt and slow our international expansion and partnership efforts, as our international partners businesses could be disrupted. We may not be successful in our international partnerships, expansion efforts, and we may incur significant operating expenses in our efforts to expand internationally.  We have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to continue to devote substantial time to various compliance initiatives.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as other rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE , impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. These and proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs. If compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our managements attention from other business concerns, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually and disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. If we are unable to assert in any future reporting periods that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls , we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have an adverse effect on our share price.  Although we believe that we currently maintain effective control over our disclosures and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may in the future identify deficiencies regarding the design and effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting. If we experience any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future or are unable to provide unqualified management or attestation reports about our internal controls, we may be unable to meet financial and other reporting deadlines and may incur costs associated with remediation, and any of which could cause our share price to decline. Moreover, if we identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses in future periods, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline, and we could be subject to potential delisting by the NYSE and review by the NYSE, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which would require the expenditure by us of additional financial and management resources. As a result, our shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the market price of our ordinary shares.  Index  There are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  including intangible assets , liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses, and income. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.  Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected by the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies.  As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, in December 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  the Tax Act  was enacted, which contained significant changes to U.S. tax law, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a transition to a new territorial system of taxation. The impact of future changes to U.S. and foreign tax law on our business is uncertain and could be adverse, and we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of any such changes.  War, terrorism, other acts of violence, or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operates, our clients and our service delivery.  Our business may be adversely affected by instability, disruption, or destruction in a geographic region in which we operates, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection, or social unrest, and natural or manmade disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm, or pandemic events and spread of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such events may cause our customers to delay their decisions on spending for the services we provide and give rise to sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events may also pose risks to our personnel and to physical facilities and operations, which could adversely affect our financial results.  The global COVID-19 pandemic may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was reported in China and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak has continued to spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity and financial markets. In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the spread of COVID-19, we have taken precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees, our customers, and other third parties with whom we interact. We are requiring all employees to work remotely and have also suspended all non-essential travel worldwide for our employees. While we have a distributed workforce and our employees are accustomed to working remotely or working with other remote employees, our workforce is not fully remote. Our employees and consultants travel frequently to establish and maintain relationships with one another, our customers and prospective customers, partners, and investors. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance becomes available, temporarily suspending travel and restricting the ability to do business in person could negatively affect our customer success efforts, sales and marketing efforts, challenge our ability to enter into customer contracts in a timely manner, slow down our recruiting efforts, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, not possible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security and fraud concerns as well as increase our exposure to potential wage and hour issues. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the operations of our customers, partners, suppliers, and other third-party providers for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of travel restrictions, adverse effects on budget planning processes, and or business shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. More generally, the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect economies and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn, which could decrease technology spending and adversely affect our business.  Index  Risks Related to Our Common Stock  Trading in our common stock is limited and the price of our common shares may be subject to substantial volatility.  Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and was previously listed on the NYSE American LLC  formerly the NYSE MKT LLC . Over the past years, the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations. Between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, the reported last adjusted closing price on the NYSE American LLC, and now NYSE, for our common stock ranged between  3.20 and  7.54 per share. The price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but not limited to, the following    Developments or lack thereof in any then-outstanding litigation;   Quarterly variations in our operating results;   Large purchases or sales of common stock or derivative transactions related to our stock;   Actual or anticipated announcements of new products or services by us or competitors;   General conditions in the markets in which we compete; and   General social, political, economic, and financial conditions, including the significant volatility in the global financial markets, and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, we believe there has been and may continue to be substantial trading in derivatives of our stock, including short selling activity or related similar activities, which are beyond our control and which may be beyond the full control of the SEC and Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority or FINRA. While the SEC and FINRA rules prohibit some forms of short selling and other activities that may result in stock price manipulation, such activity may nonetheless occur without detection or enforcement. We have held conversations with regulators concerning trading activity in our stock; however, there can be no assurance that should there be any illegal manipulation in the trading of our stock, it will be detected, prosecuted, or successfully eradicated. Significant short selling market manipulation could cause our stock trading price to decline, to become more volatile, or both.  The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.  The trading price of our common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and is likely to continue to be volatile. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include, but are not limited to the following    Price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative market sentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;   Volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable;   Changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies generally, or those in our industry;   Sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;  Index   Failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow us, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;   The financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;   Announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;   The publics reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;   Rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;   Actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations;   Actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;   Litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;   Announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;   New laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;   Changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;   Any significant change in our management; and   General economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets, including any economic downturn from the COVID-19 pandemic;  Further, in recent years the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the stock prices of many technology companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, government shutdowns, global pandemics  such as the COVID-19 pandemic , interest rate changes the stability of the EU and the exit of the United Kingdom or international currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies.  We have broad discretion in how we apply our funds, and we may not use these funds effectively, which could affect our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.  Our management will have broad discretion in the application of our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. Pending their use, we may invest our available funds in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. The failure by our management to apply our available funds effectively could result in financial losses that could cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our products.  In addition, an entity that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading, or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an Investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940  the 1940 Act . If we do not manage our investments and business in a manner that meets the requirements for an exemption under the 1940 Act, we may be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act and subject to additional limitations on operating our business including limitations on the issuance of securities, which may make it difficult for us to raise capital.  Index  We do not regularly pay dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments.  Our dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and investment opportunities. We therefore cannot make assurances that our Board of Directors will determine to pay regular or special dividends in the future. Accordingly, unless our Board of Directors determines to pay dividends, stockholders will be required to look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur.  The exercise of our outstanding stock options, warrants and RSUs and issuance of new shares would result in a dilution of our current stockholders voting power and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market which may negatively impact the market price of our stock.  The exercise of our outstanding vested stock options, warrants and RSUs would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding options, warrants and RSUs to purchase an aggregate of 6,341,844 shares of common stock representing approximately 9  of our total shares outstanding of which 4,426,250 were vested and therefore exercisable. To the extent outstanding stock options are exercised, additional shares of common stock will be issued, existing stockholders percentage voting interests will decline and the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market will increase. Such increase may have a negative effect on the value or market trading price of our common stock.  The market price of our common stock may decline because our operating results may not be consistent and may be difficult to predict.  Our reported net income has fluctuated in the past due to several factors. We expect that our future operating results may also fluctuate due to the same or similar factors. While we had net income of  280.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, we had net losses of  19.2 million for 2019 and  25.4 million for 2018, and as of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated deficits of  8.0 million. The following include some of the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate    The outcome of actions to enforce our intellectual property rights currently in progress or that we may undertake in the future, and the timing thereof;   The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our sales cycle and results;   The amount and timing of receipt of license fees from potential infringers, licensees, or customers;   The rate of adoption of our patented technologies;   The number of new license arrangements we may execute, or that may expire, within a particular period and the scope of those licenses, including the number of our patents which are licensed, the extent of prior infringement of our patent rights, royalty rates, timing of payment obligations, expiration date etc.;   The success of a licensee in selling products that use our patented technologies; and   The amount and timing of expenses related to our patent filings and enforcement proceedings, including litigation, related to our intellectual property rights.  These fluctuations may make our business particularly difficult to manage, adversely affect our business and operating results, make our operating results difficult for investors to predict and, further, cause our results to fall below investors expectations and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Because ownership of our common stock is concentrated, investors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions.  As of December 31, 2020, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 13  of our outstanding common stock. In addition, a group of stockholders that, as of December 31, 2007, held 4,766,666 shares, or approximately 7  of our outstanding common stock, have entered into a voting agreement with us that requires them to vote all of their shares of our voting stock in favor of the director nominees approved by our Board of Directors at each director election going forward, and in a manner that is proportional to the votes cast by all other voting shares as to any other matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote. However, we cannot be certain how many shares of our common stock this group of stockholders currently owns. Because of their beneficial ownership interest, our officers and directors could significantly influence stockholder actions of which you disapprove or that are contrary to your interests. This ability to exercise significant influence could prevent or significantly delay another company from acquiring or merging with us.  Index  Our protective provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for a third party to successfully acquire us even if you would like to sell your stock to them.  We have a number of protective provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that could delay, discourage, or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These protective provisions include    A staggered Board of Directors  This means that only one or two directors  since we have a five-person Board of Directors  will be up for election at any given annual meeting. This has the effect of delaying the ability of stockholders to affect a change in control of us because it would take two annual meetings to effectively replace a majority of the Board of Directors.   Blank check preferred stock  Our Board of Directors has the authority to establish the rights, preferences, and privileges of our 10,000,000 authorized, but unissued, shares of preferred stock. Therefore, this stock may be issued at the discretion of our Board of Directors with preferences over your shares of our common stock in a manner that is materially dilutive to you. In addition, blank check preferred stock can be used to create a poison pill which is designed to deter a hostile bidder from buying a controlling interest in our stock without the approval of our Board of Directors. We have not adopted such a poison pill; but our Board of Directors has the ability to do so in the future, very rapidly and without stockholder approval.   Advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings  Stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters to a vote of the stockholders must provide notice to us within very specific date windows and in very specific form in order to have the matter voted on at a stockholder meeting. This has the effect of giving our Board of Directors and management more time to react to stockholder proposals generally and could also have the effect of disregarding a stockholder proposal or deferring it to a subsequent meeting to the extent such proposal is not raised properly.   No stockholder actions by written consent  No stockholder or group of stockholders may take actions rapidly and without prior notice to our Board of Directors and management or to the minority stockholders. Along with the advance notice requirements described above, this provision also gives our Board of Directors and management more time to react to proposed stockholder actions.   Super majority requirement for stockholder amendments to the bylaws  Stockholder proposals to alter or amend our bylaws or to adopt new bylaws can only be approved by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2 3  of the outstanding shares of our common stock.   No ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders  Only the Board of Directors or management can call special meetings of the stockholders. This could mean that stockholders, even those who represent a significant percentage of our shares of common stock, may need to wait for the annual meeting before nominating directors or raising other business proposals to be voted on by the stockholders.  In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, particularly those owning 15  or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.  These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.  Index  Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.  Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for  1  any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf,  2  any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders,  3  any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or  4  any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware  or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware , in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants.  However, notwithstanding the exclusive forum provisions, our amended and restated bylaws explicitly state that they would not preclude the filing of claims brought to enforce any liability or duty created under federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. This exclusive-forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find this exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations."}

Our technology generates secure connections on a zero-click or single-click basis, significantly simplifying the deployment of secure real-time communication solutions by eliminating the need for end-users to enter any encryption information. Our portfolio of intellectual property is the foundation of our business model. We currently own approximately 194 total patents and pending applications, including 70 U.S. patents patent applications and 124 foreign patents validations pending applications. Our patent portfolio is primarily focused on securing real-time communications over the Internet, and related services, and is used in all our technology and products, some of which were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary; VirnetX, Inc., from Leidos, Inc., or Leidos,  f k a Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC  in 2006.  Our product portfolio includes sophisticated technologies, products and services that are available for sale worldwide. Our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform includes a set of software libraries with application interfaces available for securing third-party applications seamlessly across multiple operating systems. It enables individuals and organizations to maintain complete ownership and control over their personal and confidential data, secured within their own private network, while enabling authorized secure encrypted access from anywhere at any time.  Index  Our GABRIEL Gateway product extends our Secure Communication Platform by allowing existing networked devices and services to seamlessly join the GABRIEL SECURED network without requiring any modifications. All these devices or services, including on-premise or cloud-based services, can now be assigned a VirnetX Secure Domain Name and use fully authenticated, secure communication channels for its communications.  Our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite is a set of communication applications and tools that use our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform. It enables seamless and secure cross-platform communications between devices that are enrolled in our GABRIEL SECURED network and have our software installed. Our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite is available for download and free trial, for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms, at https   virnetx.com.  We continue to enhance our products and add new functionality. We will provide updates to new and existing customers as they are released to the public. Many small and medium businesses have installed our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform and GABRIEL Collaboration Suite products in their corporate networks. We intend to continue to expand our customer base with targeted promotions and direct sales initiatives.  We have an ongoing GABRIEL Licensing Program under which we offer licenses to a portion of our patent portfolio, technology, and software, including our secure domain name registry service, to domain infrastructure providers, communication service providers as well as to system integrators. Our GABRIEL Connection Technology License is offered to OEM customers who want to adopt the GABRIEL Connection Technology as their solution for establishing secure connections using secure domain names within their products. We have developed GABRIEL Connection Technology Software Development Kit  SDK  to assist with rapid integration of these techniques into existing software implementations. Customers who want to develop their own implementation of the VirnetX patented techniques for supporting secure domain names, or other techniques that are covered by our patent portfolio for establishing secure communication links, can purchase a patent license. The number of patents licensed, and therefore the cost of the patent license to the customer, will depend upon which of the patents are used in a particular product or service. These licenses will typically include an initial license fee, as well as an ongoing royalty.  Our employees include the core development team behind our patent portfolio, technology, and software. Some members of this team have worked together for over twenty years and were on same team that invented and developed this technology while working at Leidos, Inc.  Leidos . The team has continued its research and development work and expanded the set of patents we acquired in 2006 from Leidos, into a larger patent portfolio. This portfolio now serves as the foundation of our products, services, and our licensing business. It is expected to generate most of our future revenue in license fees and royalties. We intend to continue our efforts to develop new products and technologies and further strengthen and expand our patent portfolio. We intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by, for example, offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents.  Index  Litigation  all dollar amounts in this section are expressed in thousands except for rates per device   We have several intellectual property infringement lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division  USDC , and United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  USCAFC  and the Supreme Court of the United States  SCOTUS .  VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc. et al.  Case 6 10-CV-00417-LED   Apple I   On August 11, 2010, we filed a complaint against Aastra USA. Inc.  Aastra , Apple Inc.  Apple , Cisco Systems, Inc.  Cisco , and NEC Corporation  NEC  the USDC in which we alleged that these parties infringe on certain of our patents  U.S. Patent Nos. 6,502,135, 7,418,504, 7,921,211 and 7,490,151 . We sought damages and injunctive relief. The cases against each defendant were separated by the judge. Aastra and NEC agreed to sign license agreements with us, and we dropped all accusations of infringement against them. A jury in USDC decided that our patents were not invalid and rendered a verdict of non-infringement by Cisco on March 4, 2013. Our motion for a new Cisco trial was denied and the case against Cisco was closed.  On November 6, 2012, a jury in the USDC awarded us over  368,000 for Apples infringement of four of our patents, plus daily interest up to the final judgment.  Apple filed an appeal of the judgment to the USCAFC. On September 16, 2014, USCAFC affirmed the USDC jurys finding that all four of our patents at issue are valid and confirmed the USDC jurys finding of infringement of VPN on Demand under many of the asserted claims of our 135 and 151 patents, and the USDCs decision to allow evidence about our license and royalty rates regarding the determination of damages. However, the USCAFC vacated the USDC jurys damages award and some of the USDCs claim construction with respect to parts of our 504 and 211 patents and remanded the damages award and determination of infringement with respect to FaceTime back to the USDC for further proceedings.  On September 30, 2016, pursuant to the 2014 remand from the USCAFC, a jury in the USDC awarded us  302,400 for Apples infringement of four of our patents. On September 29, 2017, the USDC entered its final judgment, denied all of Apples post-trial motions, granted all our post-trial motions, including our motion for willful infringement and enhanced the royalty rate during the willfulness period from  1.20 to  1.80 per device, and awarded us costs, certain attorneys fees, and prejudgment interest. The total amount in the final judgment was  439,700, including  302,400  jury verdict ,  41,300  enhanced damages  and  96,000  costs, fees, and interest .  On October 27, 2017 Apple appealed the final judgment entered on September 29, 2017 to the USCAFC. Oral arguments in this case were held on January 8, 2019. On January 15, 2019, the Court issued a Rule 36 order affirming the district courts final judgment. Apple filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en-banc in this matter on February 21, 2019. On October 1, 2019, USCAFC issued an order denying Apples petition. Apple filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the SCOTUS, which was denied on February 24, 2020. Prior to the SCOTUS decision denying Apples petition for a writ of certiorari, on February 20, 2020, Apple filed a Rule 60 b  motion for relief from judgment with the USDC, seeking relief from the district courts September 29, 2017 final judgment. VirnetX filed a responsive brief in opposition on March 5, 2020.  Index  On March 13, 2020, the Company received payment of  454,034 from Apple, representing the previously announced final judgment with interest in this case. Apple sought payment relief by filing a motion under Rule 60 b . On September 1, 2020 USDC issued an order denying Apples motion for relief of judgement. This case is now closed.  VirnetX Inc. v. Apple, Inc.  Case 6 12-CV-00855-LED   Apple II   This case began on November 6, 2012, when we had filed a complaint against Apple in USDC in which we alleged that Apple infringed on certain of our patents,  U.S. Patent Nos. 6,502,135, 7,418,504, 7,921,211 and 7,490,151 . We sought damages and injunctive relief. The accused products include the iPhone 5, iPod Touch 5th Generation, iPad 4th Generation, iPad mini, and the latest Macintosh computers; these products were not included in the Apple I case because they were released after the Apple I case was initiated. Post-trial motions hearing was held on July 18, 2018. On August 31, 2018, the USDC entered a Final Judgment and issued its Memorandum Opinion and Order regarding post-trial motions, affirming the jurys verdict of  502,600 and granting VirnetX motions for supplemental damages, a sunset royalty, and the royalty rate of  1.20 per infringing iPhone, iPad and Mac products, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and costs. Apple filed a notice of appeal with the USCAFC in the Apple II case.  On October 9, 2018, USCAFC docketed the appeal as Case No. 19-1050 - VirnetX Inc. v. Apple Inc . On January 24, 2019 Apple filed its opening brief. We filed our response brief on March 1, 2019. Apple filed its reply brief on April 5, 2019. The oral arguments were heard on October 4, 2019. On November 22, 2019, the USCAFC issued an opinion affirming the district courts findings that Apple is precluded from making certain invalidity arguments and that Apple infringed the 135 and 151 patents; reversing the USDCs finding that Apple infringed the 504 and 211 patents; and remanding the case for proceedings on damages. Apple sought panel and en banc rehearing, which the USCAFC denied on February 10, 2020.  On February 22, 2020, the USDC issued a scheduling order for the parties to brief the court about the need for a new trial for recalculating the damages. We filed our motion for entry of judgment on February 28, 2020. The arguments on this matter were heard on April 14, 2020. In its order, unsealed on May 1, 2020, the USDC denied VirnetXs motion for entry of a new judgment based on the prior jury verdict and ordered a new jury trial on damages. On August 10, 2020, the USDC granted Apples motion for continuance and reset the date to October 26, 2020. On October 30, 2020, a jury returned a  502,800 verdict in favor of VirnetX based on Apples infringement of two network security patents  VirnetX US Patents No. 6,502,135 and No. 7,490,151. The jury verdict called for damages of  0.84 per accused device since the 2013 launch of Apples iOS 7 operating system and represents 598,629,580 infringing units from US sales only. On January 15, 2021, the district court denied Apples motion for judgment as a matter of law, and on February 4, 2021, Apple filed a notice of appeal to the USCAFC.  VirnetX Inc. v. Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd., Apple Inc.  USCAFC Case 20-2271  and VirnetX Inc. v. Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd., Apple Inc., and Black Swamp, LLC  USAFC Case 20-2272   On September 15, 2020, we filed with the USCAFC an appeal of the invalidity findings by the PTAB in inter-partes review proceedings IPR2015-01046 and IPR2016-00062 involving our U.S. Patent No. 6,502,135, and an appeal of the invalidity findings by the PTAB in inter partes review proceedings IPR2015-1047, IPR2016- 00063, and IPR2016-00167 involving our U.S. Patent No. 7,490,151. On September 25, 2020, the USCAFC issued an order consolidating the two appeals. On December 15, 2020, we filed a motion to vacate the PTAB decisions below and to remand these appeals to the PTAB, which remains pending. In view of our motion to remand, our deadline to file an initial brief is currently stayed.  Iancu v. Luoma  SCOTUS Case 20-74   On July 23, 2020, the United States and the USPTO  collectively, the United States  filed a petition for a writ of certiorari from several decisions by the USAFC, including decisions in VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc., Nos. 2019-1671, and VirnetX Inc. v. Iancu, Nos. 2017-2593, -2594. In those cases, the USAFC granted VirnetXs motions to vacate the underlying decisions of the PTAB on the basis of Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith   Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320  Fed. Cir. 2019 , and remanded for further proceedings. The United States requested that the SCOTUS hold its certiorari petition pending the disposition of the United States separate petition in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., No. 19-1434  filed June 25, 2020 . On August 26, 2020, VirnetX filed a response, agreeing that the United States certiorari petition should be held pending the disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari in No. 19-1434  and related petitions filed by private parties in Nos. 19-1452 and 19-1458 , and any further SCOTUS proceedings.  Index  On October 13, 2020, SCOTUS granted the United States petition for a writ of certiorari in No. 19-1434 as to USAFC Case No. 2018-2140, and the petitions for writs of certiorari in Nos. 19-1452 and 19-1458, all limited to Questions 1 and 2 as set forth in the July 22, 2020 Memorandum for the United States filed in No. 19-1434. The consolidated petition is seeking review of decisions by the USCAFC holding that administrative patent judges  APJ  of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and, whether the remedy imposed by USCAFC that federal laws that place restrictions on when officials can be removed from office cannot apply to APJ, was the appropriate one. SCOTUS heard oral argument in these consolidated cases on March 1, 2021.  McKool Smith P.C. v. VirnetX, Inc., AAA Case No. 01-20-0003-7975  On March 23, 2020, the law firm of McKool Smith, P.C.  McKool  filed a Demand for Arbitration against VirnetX, Inc. with the American Arbitration Association  AAA . In its demand, McKool claims that a retention agreement it entered into in 2010 with VirnetX entitles it to a contingency fee arising from the recent 2020 payment made by Apple. McKool claims it is owed approximately  36,300  or 8  of the Apple I payment . We have filed a general response with the AAA denying McKools claim and are contesting the matter vigorously. An evidentiary hearing was held on the matter during the week of February 22, 2021 and the parties will be submitting additional briefing. A ruling is expected sometime thereafter.  Neal Hurwitz v. Kendall Larsen et al.  Case 2020-0425-JRS   On June 2, 2020, stockholder Neal Hurwitz filed a verified derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kendall Larsen, Robert D. Short Ill, Gary Feiner, Michael F. Angelo, and Thomas M. OBrien and naming the Company as nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment arising out of a series of previously-disclosed transactions and compensation awards and seeks an award of monetary damages and equitable relief. On July 1, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on a failure to plead demand futility and a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and, on August 19, 2020, the defendants filed an opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss. On October 16, 2020, plaintiff amended his complaint rather than respond to the arguments in the defendants opening brief. On October 23, 2020, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint based on a failure to plead demand futility and a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. On January 12, 2021, Hurwitz voluntarily dismissed his suit without prejudice.  Other Legal Matters  One or more potential intellectual property infringement claims may also be available to us against certain other companies who have the resources to defend against any such claims. Although we believe these potential claims are likely valid, commencing a lawsuit can be expensive and time-consuming, and there is no assurance that we could prevail on such potential claims if we made them. In addition, bringing a lawsuit may lead to potential counterclaims which may distract our management and our other resources, including capital resources, from efforts to successfully commercialize our products.  Currently, we are not a party to any other pending legal proceedings and are not aware of any proceeding threatened or contemplated against us.  Commitments and Related Party Transactions  We lease our offices under an operating lease with a third party expiring in October 2021. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  We entered into a service agreement for the use of an aircraft from K2 Investment Fund LLC  LLC  for business travel for employees of the Company. We incurred approximately  324, and  1,790 in rental fees and reimbursements to the LLC during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We pay for the Companys business usage of the aircraft and have no right to purchase. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Administrative Officer are the managing partners of the LLC and control the equity interests of the LLC. We entered into a 12-month non-exclusive agreement with the LLC for use of the plane at a rate of  8 per flight hour, with no minimum usage requirement. The agreement contains other terms and conditions normal in such transactions and can be cancelled by either us or the LLC with 30 days notice. The agreement renews on an annual basis unless terminated by either party. Neither party has exercised their termination rights.  Index  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  GAAP  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. The critical accounting policies we employ in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those which involve impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, fair value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation.  Basis of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VirnetX Holding Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Use of Estimates  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In doing so, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in our accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, at the time they are made, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.  Leases  The Company determines if an arrangement, giving the Company a right-of-use  ROU  asset, is a lease at inception. Operating lease ROU assets are included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the arrangement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Other assets at December 31, 2020, include a ROU asset related to a facility lease for corporate promotional and marketing purposes. The facility lease was paid in full at inception and the ROU is being amortized over the term of the lease. Other assets also include an ROU related to our office operating lease which expires in October 2021  See Note 13 - Leases .  Revenue Recognition  The Company derives revenue from licensing and royalty fees from contracts with customers which often span several years. We account for this revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our revenue arrangements may consist of multiple-element arrangements, with revenue for each unit of accounting recognized as the product or service is delivered to the customer.  With the licensing of our patents, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time as work is complete when our patent rights are transferred to our customers. We generally have no further obligation to our customers regarding our technology.  Certain contracts may require our customers to enter into a hosting arrangement with us and for these arrangements, revenue is recognized over time, generally over the life of the servicing contract.  The Company actively monitors and enforces its intellectual property  IP  rights, including seeking appropriate compensation from third parties that utilize the Companys IP without a license. As a result, the Company may, from time to time, receive payments as part of a settlement or compensation for a patent infringement dispute. Proceeds received are allocated to each element identified in the settlement or compensation, based on the fair value of each element. Generally, settlements and compensation may include the following elements  the value of a license or royalty agreement, cost reimbursement, damages, and interest. Elements identified related to licensing and royalty are recognized as revenue. Elements identified as reimbursed costs are generally recorded as a reduction to the reported expenses. Elements identified as damages or interest are generally recorded in other income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.  Index  Licensing Costs  Licensing costs are incurred pursuant to favorable court decisions relating to patent infringement cases and are included in operating expenses in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.  Contingent Gains  ASC Topic 450-30-25, Contingent Gains, prohibits recognition of contingent gains until realized. Accordingly, we do not record contingent gains ahead of such realization. Management generally considers any such gains as realized only upon the collection of cash.  Earnings  Loss  Per Share  Basic earnings  loss  per share are computed by dividing earnings  loss  available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.  Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties  Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained at two major financial institutions in the United States. A portion of those balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had funds which were uninsured. We do not believe that we are subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships with major financial institutions. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  We identify and record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable, but not less than annually. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the anticipated future net undiscounted cash flows to the related assets carrying value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset.  Income Taxes  We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities. We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from actual results reflected on the income tax returns filed during the following years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent years. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the tax rate change is enacted. In assessing our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  A valuation allowance is provided for deferred income tax assets when, in our judgment, based upon currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on an on-going evaluation of current information including, among other things, historical operating results, estimates of future earnings in different taxing jurisdictions and the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences. We believe the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred income tax asset is a significant accounting estimate because it is based, among other things, on an estimate of future taxable income in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur, and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material. In determining when to release the valuation allowance established against our net deferred income tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative. Due to the 2020 income, we have released the valuation allowance against federal net deferred tax assets, and we maintain a partial valuation allowance against the state net operating loss and credit carryovers due to lack of income in California. We continually assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which our deferred tax assets may be realized. If and when we believe it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets, we will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in our statements of operations.  Index  We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The U.S. GAAP method of accounting for uncertain tax positions utilizes a two-step approach to evaluate tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires evaluation of the tax position to determine if based solely on technical merits it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, is addressed only if a position is more likely than not to be sustained. In step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities. If a position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition in step one, no benefit is recorded until the first subsequent period in which the more likely than not standard is met, the issue is resolved with the taxing authority, or the statute of limitations expires. Positions previously recognized are derecognized when we subsequently determine the position no longer is more likely than not to be sustained. Evaluation of tax positions, their technical merits, and measurements using cumulative probability are highly subjective management estimates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  Stock-based Compensation  We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value recognition method. We recognize these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally based on the option vesting term of 4 years.  In addition, we record stock-based compensation expense for awards granted to non-employees at fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity investments issued generally as they vest over the performance period.  Fair Value  We apply fair value accounting to all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement   Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  Our financial instruments are stated at amounts that equal, or are intended to approximate, fair value. When we approximate fair value, we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument, including assumptions about risk and inputs to the valuation technique. We use quoted valuation techniques, primarily the income and market approach that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs for recurring fair value measurements.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  issued Accounting Standards Update  ASU  2019-12 Income Taxes  Topic 740 . The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  Index  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance within ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05  collectively, ASU 2016-13 . The amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with the current expected credit loss model, which requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate credit losses. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Results of Operations  all amounts in this section are expressed in thousands   Revenue  Revenue     302,636     Revenue generated for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  302,636 compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of  85. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company collected a lump sum payment of  454,034 from Apple, Inc.  see Legal Proceedings , as a result of a favorable court decision relating to a patent infringement case. The one-time payment includes past royalties, damages for willful infringement, interest, court costs and attorneys fees.  See Revenue Recognition in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   We recognized royalty revenue as part of license agreements entered into with customers during the patent infringement actions  see Litigation . These revenues relate to payment for use of our patented technology prior to the signing of a license agreement, and royalty payments after the execution of the license agreements.  Licensing Costs  Included in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were  90,101 in licensing costs we incurred in conjunction with the proceeds received from Apple Inc., pursuant to a favorable court decision relating to a patent infringement case.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and Development     8,830     3,845  Research and development costs include expenses paid to outside development consultants and compensation-related expenses for our engineering staff. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Our research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were  8,830 compared to December 31, 2019 of  3,845. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased compensation expense.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, General and Administrative     45,812     15,905  Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation expense for management and administrative personnel, as well as expenses for outside legal, accounting, and consulting services.  Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were  45,812 compared to December 31, 2019 of  15,905. The volatility within selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal fees related to cases involving the defense of our patents. Legal fees were  30,699 and  5,898 in 2020 and 2019, respectively and represent approximately 67  of selling, general and administrative expenses for 2020 compared to 37  for 2019.  Gain on Settlement  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain of  41,271 pursuant to a favorable court ruling in the case regarding Apple, Inc. discussed above.  See Revenue Recognition in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Interest and Other Income, net  Interest and Other Income     108,288     Index  Interest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  108,288 compared to December 31, 2019 of  92. During 2020 we received interest of  108,221 pursuant to a favorable court ruling in the case with Apple, Inc. discussed above.  See Revenue Recognition in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Effective Income Tax Rate  A reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows   Year Ended  December 31, 2020  Year Ended  December 31, 2019  United States federal statutory rate  21.00     21.00     State taxes, net of federal benefit  0.17     1.99     Valuation allowance   12.22        21.96       Stock based compensation   0.01       -  R D Credit   0.21       1.34     Other  0.06      0.38       Effective income tax rate  8.79     1.99     The Companys effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory Federal income tax rate primarily due to the change in valuation allowance. In 2020 we had pre-tax income of  307,452 and in 2019 we had pre-tax losses of  19,573. At December 31, 2020, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of  107,989. All of the Federal net operating loss  NOL  carryforwards have been utilized to offset the taxable income in 2020. The state NOL carryforwards begin expiring in 2029.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled  192,908 and our short-term investments totaled  28,348 compared to  3,135 and  2,394, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.  We expect that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to fund our current level of selling, general and administration costs, including legal expenses and provide related working capital for the foreseeable future. Over the longer term, we expect to derive the majority of our future revenue from license fees and royalties associated with our patent portfolio, technology, software and secure domain name registry in the United States and other markets around the world.  Universal Shelf Registration and ATM Offering  On July 30, 2018 we filed a  100,000 universal shelf registration statement on SEC Form S-3 which was declared effective by the SEC on August 16, 2018. We also entered an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement  ATM  with Cowen   Company, LLC on August 31, 2018, under which we can offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to  50,000.  We use the ATM proceeds for GABRIEL product development, marketing, and general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, other corporate expenses and acquisitions of complementary products, technologies, or businesses. As of December 31, 2020, common stock with an aggregate value of up to  21,964 remained available for offer and sale under the ATM agreement.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 1,049,382 shares under the ATM. The average sales price per common share was  4.41 and the aggregate proceeds from the sales totaled  4,627 during the period. Sales commissions, fees and other costs associated with the ATM totaled  139."}

{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. Risk Factors  Before deciding to invest in J2 Global or to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock will likely decline and you may lose part or all of your investment.  Risk Factors Summary  The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.  Risks Related To Our Business  Acquisitions and investments in our business play a significant role in our growth.  Acquisitions may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.  The majority of our revenue within the Digital Media business is derived from short-term advertising arrangements, and our Digital Media business may lose or be unable to attract advertisers if it cannot develop, commission or acquire compelling content, if it cannot attract users to mobile offerings or if advertisers marketing budgets are cut or reduced.  We face risks associated with system failures, security breaches and other technological issues.  COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental response could negatively affect our business, operations and financial performance.  We face risks associated with political instability and volatility in the economy.  Our cloud fax services constitute a significant percentage of our revenue.  Our business is highly dependent on our billing systems functioning properly, and we face risks associated with card declines and merchant standards imposed by card companies.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in growing our brands or revenue.  We face potential liability for various types of legal claims, and we may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could divert significant operational resources and our managements time and attention.  We face risks associated with changes in our tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, assessments or audits by taxing authorities and potential exposure to additional tax liabilities  including with respect to sales and use, telecommunications or similar taxes .  We may be subject to risks from international operations, including risks associated with currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls, the United Kingdoms decision to end its membership in the European Union and other adverse changes in global financial markets, including unforeseen global crises such as war, strife, strikes, global health pandemics.  We may be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and we may be unable to adequately protect of our own intellectual property rights.  Our business is dependent on the supply of services and other business requirements from other companies.  Our business is dependent on our retention of our executive officers, senior management and our ability to hire and retain key personnel.  Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position, and we require significant cash to service our debt and fund our capital requirements.  We are exposed to risk if we cannot maintain or adhere to our internal controls and procedures.  We face risks associated with our Convertible Notes, including the possibility of changes in interest deductions, triggering of the conditional conversion feature, lack of funds to settle conversions or repurchase notes, use of particular accounting methods, and imposition of restrictions on future debt.  Our businesses depend in part on attracting visitors to our websites from search engines.  Risks Related To Our Industries  We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase our costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect our business. These may in turn subject us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices.  We operate across many different markets and may be exposed to a variety of government and private actions or self-regulatory developments regarding data privacy and security.  Data privacy and security regulations such as the GDPR and the CCPA impose significant compliance costs and expose us to substantial risks, particularly with respect to health data or other sensitive data.  Developments in the healthcare industry and associated regulations could adversely affect our business, including our Everyday Health Group set of brands.  Our business could suffer if providers of broadband internet access services block, impair or degrade our services.  Our business could suffer if we cannot obtain or retain numbers, are prohibited from obtaining local numbers or are limited to distributing local numbers to only certain customers.  Rate increases by regulated carriers could require us to either raise the retail prices of our offerings and lose customers or reduce our profit margins.  Our business faces risks associated with advertisement blocking technologies and advertising click fraud.  The industries in which we operate are undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not be able to keep up.  Risks Related To Our Stock  Features of the Convertible Notes and Senior Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.  Conversions of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Convertible Notes.  We are a holding company and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our assets held by, subsidiaries, which are subject to restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us to fund our dividends and interest payments and other holding company expenses.  Future sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.  Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.  Our stock price may be volatile or may decline, due to various reasons, including variations between actual results and investor expectations, industry and regulatory changes, introduction of new services by our competitors, developments with respect to IP rights, geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions, and global health pandemics, among others.  Risks Related To Our Business  Acquisitions and investments in our business have historically played a significant role in our growth and we anticipate that they will continue to do so.  We must acquire additional or invest in new or current businesses, products, services and technologies that complement or augment our service offerings and customer base in order to sustain our rate of growth. We may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment strategies, manage disparate technologies, lines of business, personnel and corporate cultures, realize our business strategy or the expected return on our investment or manage a geographically dispersed company. If we are unable to identify and execute on acquisitions or execute on our investment strategies, our revenues, business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could suffer.  We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.  We intend to continue to develop new services, enhance existing services and expand our geographic presence through acquisitions of other companies, service lines, technologies and personnel.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following   Difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired businesses;  Difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions;  Diversion of managements attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions; and  The potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the businesses we acquire.  Acquisitions may also cause us to   Use a substantial portion of our cash resources or incur debt;  Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;  Assume liabilities;  Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership;  Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;  Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and  Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation.  Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control. We cannot give assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.  The majority of our revenue within the Digital Media business is derived from short-term advertising arrangements and a reduction in spending by or loss of current or potential advertisers would cause our revenue and operating results to decline.  In most cases, our agreements with advertisers have a term of one year or less and may be terminated at any time by the advertiser or by us without penalty. Advertising agreements often provide that we receive payment based on served impressions but the online ad industry has started to shift so that payment will be made based on viewable impressions, and that change in basis could have a negative effect on available impressions thereby reducing our revenue potential. Accordingly, it is difficult to forecast display revenue accurately. In addition, our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue. Moreover, we believe that advertising on the internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include budget constraints of our advertisers, cancellations or delays of projects by our advertisers, the cyclical and discretionary nature of advertising spending, general economic, internet-related and media industry conditions, as well as extraordinary events. Further, our inability to produce live events for an indefinite period of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in a reduction of spending or loss of current or potential advertisers. The state of the global economy and availability of capital has impacted and could further impact the advertising spending patterns of existing and potential advertisers. Any reduction in spending by, or loss of, existing or potential advertisers would negatively impact our revenue and operating results. Further, we may be unable to adjust our expenses and capital expenditures quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall.  If we are unable to develop, commission or acquire compelling content in our Digital Media business at acceptable prices, our expenses may increase, the number of visitors to our online properties may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, and or visitors level of engagement with our websites may decline, any of which could harm our operating results.  Our future success depends in part on the ability of our Digital Media business to aggregate compelling content and deliver that content through our online properties. We believe that users will increasingly demand high-quality content and services including more video and mobile-specific content. Such content and services may require us to make substantial payments to third parties if we are unable to develop content of our own. Our ability to maintain and build relationships with such third-party providers is critical to our success. In addition, as new methods for accessing the internet become available, including through alternative devices, we may need to enter into amended agreements with existing third-party providers to cover the new devices. We may be unable to monetize the activity on these alternative devices including mobile devices which may supplant current traffic that we monetize. We may be unable to enter into new, or preserve existing, relationships with the third-parties whose content or services we seek to obtain. In addition, as competition for compelling content increases both domestically and internationally, our third-party providers may increase the prices at which they offer their content and services to us and potential providers may not offer their content or services to us at all, or may offer them on terms that are not agreeable to us. An increase in the prices charged to us by third-party providers could harm our operating results and financial condition. Further, many of our content and services licenses with third parties are non-exclusive. Accordingly, other media providers may be able to offer similar or identical content. This increases the importance of our ability to deliver compelling content and personalization of this content for users in order to differentiate our properties from other businesses. Although we generally develop compelling content of our own, when are unable to do so we engage freelance services or obtain licensed content which may not be at reasonable prices and which could harm our operating results.  Users are increasingly using mobile devices to access our content within our Digital Media business and if we are unsuccessful in attracting new users to our mobile offerings, and expanding the capabilities of our content and other offerings with respect to our mobile platforms, our net revenues could decline.  Web usage and the consumption of digital content are increasingly shifting to mobile platforms such as smartphones and other connected devices. Visits to our mobile websites and applications have increased but if the percentage of visits to our mobile websites does not continue to grow or we are unable to effectively monetize our mobile content, net revenue will be impacted. In addition, we are less effective at monetizing digital content on our mobile websites and applications compared to our desktop websites. The growth of our business depends in part on our ability to continue to adapt to the mobile environment and to deliver compelling solutions to consumers and retailers through these new mobile marketing channels. In addition, our success on mobile platforms will be dependent on our interoperability with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control, and any changes in such systems that degrade our functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our services through mobile devices.  A system failure, security breach or other technological risk could delay or interrupt service to our customers, harm our reputation or subject us to significant liability.  Our operations are dependent on our network being free from material interruption by damage from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or any other events beyond our control. Similarly, the operations of our partners and other third parties with which we work are also susceptible to the same risks. There can be no assurance that our existing and planned precautions of backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols and other procedures will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure or data loss and the same is true for our partners, vendors and other third parties on which we rely. We have experienced automated log in attempts to gain unauthorized access to customer accounts. To date, these events have not resulted in the material impairment of any business operations.  Also, many of our services are web-based, and the amount of data we store for our users on our servers has been increasing. Despite the implementation of security measures, our infrastructure, and that of our partners, vendors and other third parties, may be vulnerable to computer viruses, hackers or similar disruptive problems caused by our vendors, partners, other third parties, subscribers, employees or other internet users who attempt to invade public and private data networks. As seen in the industries in which we operate and others, these activities have been, and will continue to be, subject to continually evolving cybersecurity and technological risks. Further, in some cases we do not have in place disaster recovery facilities for certain ancillary services. Moreover, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive data. For example, a significant number of our Cloud Services customers authorize us to bill their credit or debit card accounts directly for all transaction fees charged by us. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including customer credit and debit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a material compromise or breach of the technology used by us, our partners, vendors, or other third parties, to protect transaction and other confidential data. Any system failure or security breach that causes interruptions or data loss in our operations, our partners, vendors, or other third parties, or in the computer systems of our customers or leads to the misappropriation of our or our customers confidential information could result in a significant liability to us  including in the form of judicial decisions and or settlements, regulatory findings and or forfeitures, and other means , cause considerable harm to us and our reputation  including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and or the media , cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. Our Board is briefed on cybersecurity risks and we implement cybersecurity risk management under our Boards oversight. We use vendors to assist with cybersecurity risks, but these vendors may not be able to assist us adequately in preparing for or responding to a cybersecurity incident. We maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any breaches or other adverse consequences related to a cybersecurity-event. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, or cause us to suffer other negative consequences. For example, we may incur remediation costs  such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers or business partners in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack ; increased cybersecurity protection costs  which may include the costs of making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants ; lost revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; litigation and legal risks  including regulatory actions by state and federal governmental authorities and non-U.S. authorities ; increased insurance premiums; reputational damage that adversely affects customer or investor confidence; and damage to the companys competitiveness, stock price, and diminished long-term shareholder value. To date, these events have not resulted in the material impairment of any business operations.  In our Digital Media business, if we are unable to prove that our advertising and sponsorship solutions provide an attractive return on investment for our customers, our financial results could be harmed.  Our ability to grow revenue from our Digital Media business is dependent on our ability to demonstrate to marketers that their marketing campaigns with us provide a meaningful return on investment  ROI  relative to offline and other online opportunities. Certain of the marketing campaigns with respect to our Digital Media business are designed such that the revenues received are based entirely upon the ROI delivered for customers. Our Digital Media business has invested significant resources in developing its research, analytics and campaign effectiveness capabilities and expects to continue to do so in the future. Our ability, however, to demonstrate the value of advertising and sponsorship on Digital Media business properties will depend, in part, on the sophistication of the analytics and measurement capabilities, the actions taken by our competitors to enhance their offerings, whether we meet the ROI expectations of our customers and a number of other factors. If we are unable to maintain sophisticated marketing and communications solutions that provide value to our customers or demonstrate our ability to provide value to our customers, our financial results will be harmed.  Political instability and volatility in the economy may adversely affect segments of our customers, which may result in decreased usage and advertising levels, customer acquisition and customer retention rates and, in turn, could lead to a decrease in our revenues or rate of revenue growth.  Certain segments of our customers may be adversely affected by political instability and volatility in the general economy or renewed downturns. To the extent these customers businesses are adversely affected by political instability or volatility, their usage of our services and or our customer retention rates could decline. This may result in decreased cloud services subscription and or usage revenues and decreased advertising, e-commerce or other revenues, which may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.  The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental response could negatively affect our business, operations and financial performance.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility and overall uncertainty. Among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel bans around the world, declarations of states of emergency, stay- or shelter-at-home requirements, business and school closures and manufacturing restrictions. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to  i  increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally;  ii  sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial and capital markets;  iii  increased spending on our business continuity efforts, which has required and may further require that we cut costs or investments in other areas; and  iv  heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements.  We have adjusted certain aspects of our operations to protect our employees and customers while still seeking to meet customers needs for our vital cloud internet services and digital media services. We cannot predict at this time the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our business, operations and financial performance. The extent of any continued or future adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and outside our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Nonetheless, we believe that it is likely that our business, operations and financial performance will continue to be adversely affected until the pandemic subsides and the U.S. and worldwide economies begin to recover. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section entitled Risk Factors or in the Risk Factors section of any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Even after the pandemic subsides, it is possible that the U.S, and other major economies continue to experience a prolonged recession, which we expect would materially and adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.  Our cloud fax services constitute a significant percentage of our revenue.  Currently, cloud fax revenue constitutes approximately 22  of our consolidated revenues. The success of our business is therefore dependent upon the continued use of fax as a messaging medium and or our ability to diversify our service offerings and derive more revenue from other services, such as cybersecurity, SMB enablement solutions and services related to our Digital Media business. If the demand for cloud fax decreases, and we are unable to replace lost revenues from decreased usage or cancellation of our cloud fax services with a proportional increase in our customer base or with revenues from our other services, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  We believe that one of the attractive features of our eFax and similar products is that fax signatures are a generally accepted method of executing contracts and a method of transmitting confidential information in a secure manner especially in the healthcare field in the United States. There are ongoing efforts by governmental and non-governmental entities to create a universally accepted method for electronically signing documents. Widespread adoption of so-called digital signatures could reduce demand for our fax services and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  Our growth will depend on our ability to develop, strengthen, and protect our brands, and these efforts may be costly and have varying degrees of success.  Our brand recognition has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Strengthening our current brands and launching competitive new brands will be critical to achieving widespread commercial acceptance of our products and services. This will require our continued focus on active marketing, the costs of which have been increasing and may continue  to increase. In addition, substantial initial investments may be required to launch new brands and expand existing brands to cover new geographic territories and technology fields. Accordingly, we may need to spend increasing amounts of money on, and devote greater resources to, advertising, marketing and other efforts to cultivate brand recognition and customer loyalty. In addition, we are supporting an increasing number of brands, each of which requires its own investment of resources. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and, even if they do, increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred. A failure to launch, promote, and maintain our brands, or the incurrence of substantial expenses in doing so, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our brand recognition depends, in part, on our ability to protect our trademark portfolio and establish trademark rights covering new brands and territories. Some regulators and competitors have taken the view that certain of our brands, such as eFax and eVoice, are descriptive or generic when applied to the products and services offered by our Cloud Services business. Nevertheless, we have obtained U.S. and foreign trademark registrations for our brand names, logos, and other brand identifiers, including, eFax and eVoice. If we are unable to obtain, maintain or protect trademark rights covering our brands across the territories in which they are or may be offered, the value of these brands may be diminished, competitors may be able to dilute, harm, or take advantage of our brand recognition and reputation, and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected.  We hold domain names relating to our brands, in the U.S. and internationally. The acquisition and maintenance of domain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. The regulation of domain names may change. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to acquire or maintain all relevant domain names that relate to our brands. Furthermore, international rules governing the acquisition and maintenance of domain names in foreign jurisdictions are sometimes different from U.S. rules, and we may not be able to obtain all of our domains internationally. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our brands, trademarks or other proprietary rights. In addition, failure to secure or maintain domain names relevant to our brands could adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and services.  Increased numbers of credit and debit card declines in our business could lead to a decrease in our revenues or rate of revenue growth.  A significant number of our paid Cloud Services subscribers and certain Digital Media subscribers pay for our services through credit and debit cards. Weakness in certain segments of the credit markets and in the U.S. and global economies could result in increased numbers of rejected credit and debit card payments. We believe this could result in increased customer cancellations and decreased customer signups. Rejected credit or debit card payments, customer cancellations and decreased customer sign up may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.  If our business experiences excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card company merchant standards, we could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment and our subscriber base could decrease significantly.  A significant number of our paid Cloud Services subscribers and certain Digital Media subscribers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for all service fees charged by us. If people pay for these services with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial unreimbursed third-party vendor costs. We also incur losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction to purchase our service. If the numbers of unauthorized credit card transactions become excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks and could lose the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, we are subject to Payment Card Industry  PCI  data security standards, which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess our compliance. PCI standards are a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security. Failure to comply with the security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in fines or a restriction on accepting payment cards. Credit card companies may change the standards required to utilize their services from time to time. If we are unable to meet these new standards, we could be unable to accept credit cards. Further, the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled and states may enact their own rules with which we may not comply. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card payments, which could cause our paid subscriber base to significantly decrease, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and our competitors may have greater resources to commit to growth, superior technologies, cheaper pricing or more effective marketing strategies. Also, we face significant competition for users, advertisers, publishers, developers and distributors.  For information regarding our competition, and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled Competition contained in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, some of our competitors include major companies with much greater resources and significantly larger subscriber bases than we have. Some of these competitors offer their services at lower prices than we do. These companies may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and capabilities more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter markets that we are currently serving and plan to serve or that we will be able to compete effectively. Competitive pressures may reduce our revenue, operating profits or both.  Our Digital Media business faces significant competition from online media companies as well as from social networking sites, mobile application, traditional print and broadcast media, general purpose and search engines and various e-commerce sites. Our Cloud Services business faces competition from cloud software services and applications across several categories including secured communications, cybersecurity and marketing technology.  Several of our competitors offer an integrated variety of software and internet products, advertising services, technologies, online services and content. We compete against these and other companies to attract and retain subscribers, users, advertisers and developers. We also compete with social media and networking sites which are attracting a substantial and increasing share of users and users online time, and may continue to attract an increasing share of online advertising dollars.  In addition, several competitors offer products and services that directly compete for users with our Digital Media business offerings. Similarly, the advertising networks operated by our competitors or by other participants in the display marketplace offer services that directly compete with our offerings for advertisers, including advertising exchanges, ad networks, demand side platforms, ad serving technologies and sponsored search offerings. We also compete with traditional print and broadcast media companies to attract advertising spending. Some of our existing competitors and possible entrants may have greater brand recognition for certain products and services, more expertise in a particular segment of the market, and greater operational, strategic, technological, financial, personnel, or other resources than we do. Many of our competitors have access to considerable financial and technical resources with which to compete aggressively, including by funding future growth and expansion and investing in acquisitions, technologies, and research and development. Further, emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide new products and services faster than we can. In addition, competitors may consolidate with each other or collaborate, and new competitors may enter the market. Some of the competitors for our Cloud Services business in international markets have a substantial competitive advantage over us because they have dominant market share in their territories, are owned by local telecommunications providers, have greater brand recognition, are focused on a single market, are more familiar with local tastes and preferences, or have greater regulatory and operational flexibility due to the fact that we may be subject to both U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements.  If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing and deploying compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, developers, or distributors, our revenue and growth rates could decline.  As a creator and a distributor of content over the internet, we face potential liability for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute.  Users access health-related content through our Everyday Health Group properties, including information regarding particular medical conditions, diagnosis and treatment and possible adverse reactions or side effects from medications. If our content, or content we obtain from third parties, contains inaccuracies, it is possible that consumers or professionals who rely on that content or others may make claims against us with various causes of action. Although our properties contain terms and conditions, including disclaimers of liability, that are intended to reduce or eliminate our liability, third parties may claim that these online agreements are unenforceable.  Our editorial and other quality control procedures may not be sufficient to ensure that there are no errors or omissions in our content offerings or to prevent such errors and omissions in content that is controlled by our partners. Even if potential claims do not result in liability to us, investigating and defending against these claims could be expensive and time consuming and could divert managements attention away from our operations.  We may be engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could divert significant operational resources and our managements time and attention.  From time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims or are involved in other legal disputes or regulatory inquiries, including in the areas of patent infringement and anti-trust, that could negatively affect our business operations and financial condition. Such disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, divert operational resources, occupy a significant amount of our managements time and attention and negatively affect our business operations and financial condition. The outcomes of such matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, carrying the potential for unfavorable rulings that could include monetary damages and injunctive relief. We do not always have insurance coverage for defense costs, judgments, and settlements. We may also be subject to indemnification requirements with business partners, vendors, current and former officers and directors, and other third parties. Payments under such indemnification provisions may be material. For a more detailed description of certain lawsuits in which we are involved, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.  Our business is highly dependent on our billing systems.  A significant part of our revenues depends on prompt and accurate billing processes. Customer billing is a highly complex process, and our billing systems must efficiently interface with third-party systems, such as those of credit card processing companies. Our ability to accurately and efficiently bill our customers is dependent on the successful operation of our billing systems and the third-party systems upon which we rely, such as our credit card processor, and our ability to provide these third parties the information required to process transactions. In addition, our ability to offer new services or alternative-billing plans is dependent on our ability to customize our billing systems. Any failures or errors in our billing systems or procedures could impair our ability to properly bill our current customers or attract and service new customers, and thereby could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.  Inadequate intellectual property protections could prevent us from defending our proprietary technology and intellectual property.  Our success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, contractual restrictions, and other confidentiality safeguards to protect our proprietary technology. However, these measures may provide only limited protection and it may be costly and time-consuming to enforce compliance with our intellectual property rights. In some circumstances, we may not have adequate, economically feasible or realistic options for enforcing our intellectual property and we may be unable to detect unauthorized use. While we have a robust worldwide portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications, there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, that we will be able to successfully police infringement, or that any rights granted under these patents will in fact provide a competitive advantage to us.  In addition, our ability to register or protect our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property may be limited in some foreign countries. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from utilizing our intellectual property, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business.  We also strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We typically enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, we may not be successful in executing these agreements with every party who has access to our confidential information or contributes to the development of our technology or intellectual property rights. Those agreements that we do execute may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. These contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent the misappropriation or disclosure of our proprietary information nor deter independent development of similar technology or intellectual property by others.  Monitoring unauthorized use of the content on our websites and mobile applications, and our other intellectual property and technology, is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property may not have been and may not be adequate to prevent their misappropriation or misuse. Third parties from time to time copy content or other intellectual property or technology from our solutions without authorization and seek to use it for their own benefit. We generally seek to address such unauthorized copying or use, but we have not always been successful in stopping all unauthorized use of our content or other intellectual property or technology, and may not be successful in doing so in the future. Further, we may not have been and may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our technology or intellectual property, or to take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Companies that operate in the same industry as our Cloud Services and Digital Media businesses have experienced substantial litigation regarding intellectual property. Currently, we have pending patent infringement lawsuits, both offensive and defensive, against several companies in this industry. Furthermore, we may find it necessary or appropriate to initiate claims or litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of intellectual property rights claimed by others. This or any other litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights may be expensive and time-consuming, could divert management resources and may not be adequate to protect our business.  As we continue to grow our international operations, adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  As we expand our international operations, we could be exposed to significant risks of currency fluctuations. In some countries outside the U.S., we offer our services in the applicable local currency, including but not limited to the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the Euro, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the New Zealand Dollar, the Norwegian Kroner and the British Pound Sterling, among others. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations, which in turn may materially adversely affect reported earnings and the comparability of period to period results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and foreign competitors sell our services in the same market. In addition, changes in the value of the relevant currencies may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. Dollars. We cannot assure you that future exchange rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our future business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.  Changes in our tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our financial results.  We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. Our provision for income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory tax rates and enacted tax rules, including transfer pricing. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. As a result, our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. These changes may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.  We are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and other domestic and foreign tax authorities and government bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax and other tax reserves. If our reserves are not sufficient to cover these contingencies, such inadequacy could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.  In addition, due to the global nature of the internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business or levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries, as well as states within the United States, have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. The application of existing, new or revised taxes on our business, in particular, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the internet. The application of these taxes on our business could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.  Moreover, we are currently under or subject to examination for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. We currently have a  22.5 million reserve established for these matters. If a material indirect tax liability associated with prior periods were to be recorded, for which there is not a reserve, it could materially affect our financial results for the period in which it is recorded.  Furthermore, much of our Digital Media e-commerce revenue comes from arrangements in which we are paid by retailers to promote their digital product and service offers on our sites. Certain states have implemented regulations that require retailers to collect and remit sales taxes on sales made to residents of such states if a publisher, such as us, that facilitated that sale is a resident of such state. Paid retailers in our marketplace that do not currently have sales tax nexus in any state that subsequently passes similar regulations and in which we have operations, employees or contractors now or in the future, may significantly alter the manner in which they pay us, cease paying us for sales we facilitate for that retailer in such state, or cease using our marketplace, each of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.  We may be subject to risks from international operations.  As we continue to expand our business operations in countries outside the U.S., our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including, among others, foreign currency exchange rates; political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region; trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to provide our services; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries and affiliates. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  We have only limited experience in marketing and operating our services in certain international markets. Moreover, we have in some cases experienced and expect to continue to experience in some cases higher costs as a percentage of revenues in connection with establishing and providing services in international markets versus in the U.S. In addition, certain international markets may be slower than the U.S. in adopting the internet and or outsourced messaging and communications solutions and so our operations in international markets may not develop at a rate that supports our level of investments.  Further, the impact on the global economy as a result of unforeseen global crises such as war, strife, strikes, global health pandemics, earthquakes or major weather events or other uncontrollable events could negatively impact our revenue and operating results.  We may be found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to substantial damages or restrict our operations.  We have been and expect to continue to be subject to legal claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. The ready availability of damages and royalties and the potential for injunctive relief have increased the costs associated with litigating and settling patent infringement claims. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our resellers and users for similar claims made against them. Any claims, whether or not meritorious, could require us to spend significant time, money, and other resources in litigation, pay damages and royalties, develop new intellectual property, modify, design around, or discontinue existing products, services, or features, or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims. These licenses, if required, may not be available at all or have acceptable terms. As a result, intellectual property claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  The successful operation of our business depends upon the supply of critical business elements and marketing relationships from other companies.  We depend upon third parties for critical elements of our business, including technology, infrastructure, customer service and sales and marketing components. We rely on private third-party providers for our internet, telecommunications, website traffic and other connections and for co-location of a significant portion of our servers. In addition, we rely on third-party platforms to facilitate and provide access to products sold through our sites. Any disruption in the services provided by any of these suppliers, any adverse change in access to their platforms or services or in their terms and conditions of use or services, or any failure by them to handle current or higher volumes of activity could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. To obtain new Cloud Services customers, we have marketing agreements with operators of leading search engines and websites and employ the use of resellers to sell our products. These arrangements typically are not exclusive and do not extend over a significant period of time. Failure to continue these relationships on terms that are acceptable to us or to continue to create additional relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  Our success depends on our retention of our executive officers, senior management and our ability to hire and retain key personnel.  Our success depends on the skills, experience and performance of executive officers, senior management and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers, senior managers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, integrate and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for these people is intense, and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key employees or that we can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future.  Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and our competitive position.  Our level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business. For example, it could   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including our current indebtedness and any other indebtedness we may incur in the future;  increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other elements of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of dividends;  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;  restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.  In addition, the indenture governing the 4.625  Senior Notes of our subsidiary contains, and the agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.  The indenture governing the 4.625  Senior Notes contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions and may limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or make acquisitions, or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These include restrictions on our ability to   incur additional indebtedness;  create liens;  engage in sale-leaseback transactions;  pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock;  purchase or redeem capital stock;  make investments or certain other restricted payments;  sell assets;  enter into transactions with affiliates;  amend the terms of certain other indebtedness and organizational documents; or  effect a consolidation or merger.  A breach of the covenants under the indenture governing the 4.625  Senior Notes could result in an event of default. Such a default may allow the note holders to accelerate the Senior Notes and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event the holders of our 4.625  Senior Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness or our other indebtedness.  We are exposed to risk if we cannot maintain or adhere to our internal controls and procedures.  We have established and continue to maintain, assess and update our internal controls and procedures regarding our business operations and financial reporting. Our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding our business operations and financial reporting. However, because of the inherent limitations in this process, internal controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or misstatements. To the extent our internal controls are inadequate or not adhered to by our employees, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  If we are not able to maintain internal controls and procedures in a timely manner, or without adequate compliance, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities such as the SEC or Nasdaq. Any such action or restatement of prior-period financial results as a result could harm our business or investors confidence in J2 Global, and could cause our stock price to fall.  To service our debt and fund our other capital requirements, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control.  Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other elements of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of dividends, will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations. To some extent, this is subject to general and regional economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot ensure that we will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional indebtedness or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.  Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.  We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Convertible Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change or on a repurchase date or the Senior Notes upon a change in control, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Convertible Notes or the Senior Notes.  Holders of the 3.25  convertible senior notes due June 15, 2029  the 3.25  Convertible Notes  will have the right to require us to repurchase their 3.25  Convertible Notes on each of June 15, 2021 and June 15, 2024 and upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture governing the 3.25  Convertible Notes , in each case, at a repurchase price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the 3.25  Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Holders of the Senior Notes also have the right to require us to repurchase the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a change in control  as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes  at a repurchase price equal to 101  of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Holders of our 1.75  convertible senior notes due November 1, 2026  the 1.75  Convertible Notes, and together with the 3.25  Convertible Notes, the Convertible Notes  also will have the right to require us to repurchase their 1.75  Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture governing the 1.75  Convertible Notes  at a repurchase price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the 1.75  Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. It is our intention to satisfy our conversion obligation by paying and delivering a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, where cash will be used to settle each  1,000 of principal and the remainder, if any, will be settled via shares of our common stock. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes or Senior Notes surrendered therefor or Convertible Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or Senior Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes or Senior Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the applicable Convertible Notes indenture would constitute a default under the Convertible Notes indenture. A default under any indenture or the fundamental change or change of control itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or the Senior Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the Convertible Notes.  The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.  In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock  other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share , we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.  The conditional conversion feature of the 3.25  Convertible Notes was triggered for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and it is reasonably likely that it will be triggered in subsequent quarters. If J2 elects to convert all or a portion of the 3.25  Convertible Notes into shares of the Companys common stock, our common stock will be diluted which could adversely affect our stock price.  Our interest deductions attributable to the 3.25  Convertible Notes may be deferred, limited or eliminated under certain conditions.  We believe that the 3.25  Convertible Notes are subject to the IRS contingent payment debt instrument regulations. This conclusion is subject to complex factual and legal uncertainty and is not binding on the IRS or the courts. If the IRS takes a contrary position and a court sustains the IRS position, our tax deductions would be severely diminished with a resulting adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to service the 3.25  Convertible Notes.  The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.  In May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB , issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion  Including Partial Cash Settlement , which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options  ASC 470-20 . Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments  such as the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes  that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as an original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes to their face amount over the respective terms of the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes. We will report larger net losses or lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current periods amortization of the debt discount and the instruments coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results and the trading price of our common stock and other securities.  In addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments  such as the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes  that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the 1.75  Convertible Notes and the 3.25  Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.  In July 2019, the FASB issued an exposure draft that proposes to change the accounting for the convertible debt instruments described above. Under the current exposure draft, an entity may no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. If the exposure draft is adopted in its current form, this could have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income. Additionally, as currently proposed, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Rather, the if-converted method may be required. Application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share. The comment period for the current exposure draft concluded in October 2019, and, following deliberations, the FASB reaffirmed the changes described above. As of February 5, 2020, the FASB is drafting the final accounting standards update, which is scheduled to go into effect for us for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with option early adoption for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2020. We cannot be sure when or if the final accounting standards update will be issued, or whether it will be issued in its current format. We also cannot be sure whether other changes may be made to the current accounting standards related to the 1.75  Convertible Notes or the 3.25  Convertible Notes, or otherwise, that could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.  The Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Companys costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Companys business.  The Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Companys activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Companys products and services less attractive to the Companys customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Companys employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Companys policies and procedures.  The United Kingdoms decision to end its membership in the European Union and other adverse changes in global financial markets could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union  EU  in a national referendum  BREXIT , and on January 31, 2020 the United Kingdom exited the EU and, on December 31, 2020, the transition period under the withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the EU ended. The results of the United Kingdoms BREXIT have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. We are continuing to evaluate the effects of BREXIT, which could potentially disrupt our access to human capital and some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations. Any of these effects of BREXIT, among others, and other adverse changes in global financial markets could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and could render us either unable to access global financial markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions.  Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected, or in the future should collect sales and use, telecommunications or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future tax, which could adversely affect our operating results.  We believe we remit state and local sales and use tax, excise, utility user, and ad valorem taxes, fees and surcharges or other similar obligations in all relevant jurisdictions in which we generate sales, based on our understanding of the applicable laws in those jurisdictions. Such tax, fees and surcharge laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction, and the application of such taxes to e-commerce businesses, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. The jurisdictions where we have sales may apply more rigorous enforcement efforts or take more aggressive positions in the future that could result in greater tax liability. In addition, in the future we may also decide to engage in activities that would require us to pay sales and use, telecommunications, or similar taxes in new jurisdictions. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  Risks Related To Our Industries  Our services may become subject to burdensome regulation, which could increase our costs or restrict our service offerings.  We believe that most of our cloud services are information services under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and related precedent, or, if not information services, that we are entitled to other exemptions, meaning that we generally are not currently subject to U.S. telecommunications services regulation at both the federal and state levels. In connection with our Cloud Services business, we utilize data transmissions over public telephone lines and other facilities provided by third-party carriers. These transmissions are subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulation by the Federal Communications Commission  the FCC , state public utility commissions and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations affect the availability of numbers, the prices we pay for transmission services, the administrative costs associated with providing our services, the competition we face from telecommunications service providers and other aspects of our market. However, as messaging and communications services converge and as the services we offer expand, we may become subject to FCC or other regulatory agency regulation. It is also possible that a federal or state regulatory agency could take the position that our offerings, or a subset of our offerings, are properly classified as telecommunications services or otherwise not entitled to certain exemptions upon which we currently rely. Such a finding could potentially subject us to fines, penalties or enforcement actions as well as liabilities for past regulatory fees and charges, retroactive contributions to various telecommunications-related funds, telecommunications-related taxes, penalties and interest. It is also possible that such a finding could subject us to additional regulatory obligations that could potentially require us either to modify our offerings in a costly manner, diminish our ability to retain customers, or discontinue certain offerings, in order to comply with certain regulations. Changes in the regulatory environment could decrease our revenues, increase our costs and restrict our service offerings. In many of our international locations, we are subject to regulation by the applicable governmental authority.  In the U.S., Congress, the FCC, and a number of states require regulated telecommunications carriers to contribute to federal and or state Universal Service Funds  USF . Generally, USF is used to subsidize the cost of providing service to low-income customers and those living in high cost or rural areas. Congress, the FCC and a number of states are reviewing the manner in which a providers contribution obligation is calculated, as well as the types of entities subject to USF contribution obligations. If any of these reforms are adopted, they could cause us to alter or eliminate our non-paid services and to raise the price of our paid services, which could cause us to lose customers. Any of these results could lead to a decrease in our revenues and net income and could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  The Telephone Consumer Protection Act  the TCPA  and FCC rules implementing the TCPA, as amended by the Junk Fax Act, prohibit sending unsolicited facsimile advertisements to telephone fax machines. The FCC, the Federal Trade Commission  FTC , or both may initiate enforcement action against companies that send junk faxes and individuals also may have a private cause of action. Although entities that merely transmit facsimile messages on behalf of others are not liable for compliance with the prohibition on faxing unsolicited advertisements, the exemption from liability does not apply to fax transmitters that have a high degree of involvement or actual notice of an illegal use and have failed to take steps to prevent such transmissions. We take significant steps to ensure that our services are not used to send unsolicited faxes on a large scale, and we do not believe that we have a high degree of involvement in or notice of the use of our service to broadcast junk faxes. However, because fax transmitters do not enjoy an absolute exemption from liability under the TCPA and related FCC and FTC rules, we could face inquiries from the FCC and FTC or enforcement actions by these agencies, or private causes of action, if someone uses our service for such impermissible purposes. If this were to occur and we were to be held liable for someones use of our service for transmitting unsolicited faxes, the financial penalties could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and harm our business reputation.  Likewise, the TCPA also prohibits placing calls or sending text messages to mobile phones without prior express consent subject to limited exceptions. Parties that solely enable calling or text messaging are only directly liable under the TCPA pursuant to federal common law vicarious liability principles. We take significant steps to ensure that users understand that they are responsible for how they use our technology including complying with relevant federal and state law. However, because we do not enjoy absolute exemption from liability under the TCPA and related FCC and FTC rules, we could face inquiries from the FCC and FTC or enforcement actions by these agencies, or private causes of action, if someone uses our service for such impermissible purposes. If this were to occur and we were to be held liable for someones use of our service for unauthorized calling or text messaging mobile users, the financial penalties could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and harm our business reputation.  Also, in the U.S., the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act  CALEA  requires any telecommunications carriers to be capable of performing wiretaps and recording other call identifying information in cooperation with law enforcement. In September 2005, the FCC expanded the definition of telecommunications carriers to include facilities-based broadband internet access providers and Voice-over-Internet-Protocol  VoIP  providers that interconnect with the public switched telephone network. As a result of this definition, J2 Globals VoIP offerings are subject to CALEA, which has impacted our operations.  We are subject to a variety of new and existing laws and regulations which could subject us to claims, judgments, monetary liabilities and other remedies, and to limitations on our business practices.  The application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations to us relating to issues such as defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, promotions, billing, consumer protection, accessibility, content regulation, data privacy, intellectual property ownership and infringement, and accreditation in many instances is unclear or unsettled. In addition, we will also be subject to any new laws and regulations directly applicable to our domestic and international activities. Further, the application of existing laws to us or our subsidiaries regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers including, for example, distribution of pharmaceuticals, alcohol or other regulated substances, adult content, tobacco, or firearms, as well as insurance and securities brokerage, and legal services, can be unclear. Internationally, we may also be subject to laws regulating our activities in foreign countries and to foreign laws and regulations that are inconsistent from country to country. Our Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses utilize contractors, freelancers and or staff from third party outsourcers to provide content and other services. However, in the future, arrangements with such individuals may not be deemed appropriate by the relevant government authority, which could result in additional costs and expenses. We may incur substantial liabilities for expenses necessary to defend such litigation or to comply with these laws and regulations, as well as potential substantial penalties for any failure to comply. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.  The use of consumer data by online service providers and advertising networks is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and international regulatory bodies, and the regulatory environment is unsettled and evolving. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, disclosure, sharing, and security of data that we receive from and about our users. Our privacy and cookie policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data are posted on our websites.  A number of U.S. federal laws, including those referenced below, impact our business. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act  DMCA  is intended, in part, to limit the liability of eligible online service providers for listing or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights of others. Portions of the Communications Decency Act  CDA  are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third-party content. We rely on the protections provided by both the DMCA and the CDA in conducting our business. If these or other laws or judicial interpretations are changed to narrow their protections, or if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar provisions in foreign lawsuits, we will be subject to greater risk of liability, our costs of compliance with these regulations or to defend litigation may increase, or our ability to operate certain lines of business may be limited. The Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act  COPPA  is intended to impose restrictions on the ability of online services to collect some types of information from children under the age of 13. In addition, the Providing Resources, Officers, and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act of 2008  PROTECT Act  requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances, as well as other federal, state or international laws and legislative efforts designed to protect children on the internet may impose additional requirements on us. U.S. export control laws and regulations impose requirements and restrictions on exports to certain nations and persons and on our business.  In certain instances, we may be subject to enhanced privacy obligations based on the type of information we store and process. While we believe we are in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, forfeitures, and other adverse actions.  The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003  the CAN-SPAM Act , which allows for penalties that run into the millions of dollars, requires commercial emails to include identifying information from the sender and a mechanism for the receiver to opt out of receiving future emails. Several states have enacted additional, more restrictive and punitive laws regulating commercial email. Foreign legislation exists as well, including Canadas Anti-Spam Legislation and the European laws that have been enacted pursuant to the GDPR and European Union Directive 2002 58 EC and its amendments. We use email as a significant means of communicating with our existing and potential users. We believe that our email practices comply with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act, state laws, and applicable foreign legislation. If we were ever found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, or any other laws or regulations, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Many third-parties are examining whether the Americans with Disabilities Act  ADA  concept of public accommodation also extends to websites and to mobile applications. Generally, some plaintiffs have argued that websites and mobile applications are places of public accommodation under Title III of the ADA and, as such, must be equipped so that individuals with disabilities can navigate and make use of subject websites and mobile applications. The issue is currently under litigation and there is a split in the federal court of appeals circuits as to what the ADA requires. Certain appellate circuits have found that websites standing alone are subject to the ADA and therefore must be accessible to people with disabilities. Other circuits, including the Ninth Circuit, which has appellate jurisdiction over federal district courts in California and is where our company is headquartered, have found that in order for websites to be places of public accommodation, and therefore subject to the ADA, there must be both a nexus between the website and the goods and services the website provides as well as a physical brick and mortar location for consumers. We cannot predict how the ADA will ultimately be interpreted as applied to websites and mobile applications.  We believe we are in compliance with relevant law. If the law changes or if certain courts with appellate jurisdiction outside of California attempt to exercise jurisdiction over us and find that our website and mobile applications must comply with the ADA, then any adjustments or requirements to implement any changes prescribed by the ADA could result in increased costs to our business, we may become subject to injunctive relief, plaintiffs may be able to recover attorneys fees, and it is possible that, while the ADA does not provide for monetary damages, we become subject to such damages through state consumer protection or other laws. It is possible that these potential liabilities could cause a material adverse effect on our operations and harm our business reputation.  Native advertising is an increasing part of our Digital Media businesss online advertising revenue. On December 22, 2015, the FTC issued Guidelines and an Enforcement Policy Statement on native advertising, described by the FTC as, in part, ads which often resemble the design, style, and functionality of the media in which they are disseminated. The Company believes it is compliant with the requirements of these guidelines on our current practices and offerings. However, we will continue to monitor what effect this guideline and other related government regulations, and how the FTC enforces it, could have on our native advertising and branded content business. In addition, the timing and extent of any enforcement by the FTC with regard to the native advertising practices by the Company, or others, could reduce the revenue we generate from this line of business. The UK similarly has issued guidelines on native advertising in the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct   Promotional Marketing  CAP Code  and is regulated, in part, by the Advertising Standards Authority. The Company believes it is compliant with the requirements of the CAP Code on our current practices and offerings and will continue to monitor the effect of these and other related governmental regulations.  As of May 25, 2018, certain data transfers from and between the European Union  EU  are subject to the GDPR. As discussed in more detail below, the GDPR prohibits data transfers from the EU to other countries outside of the EU, including the U.S., without appropriate security safeguards and practices in place. Previously, for certain data transfers from and between the EU and the U.S., J2 Global, like many other companies, had relied on what is referred to as the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor, in order to comply with privacy obligations imposed by EU countries. The European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor. Additionally, other countries that relied on the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor that were not part of the EU have also found that data transfers to the U.S. are no longer valid based on the European Court of Justice ruling. Although U.S. and EU policymakers approved a new framework known as Privacy Shield that would allow companies like us to continue to rely on some form of a safe harbor for the transfer of certain data from the EU to the U.S., on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as invalid the European Commissions Decision  EU  2016 1250 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, rendering it invalid. We cannot predict how or if these issues will be resolved nor can we evaluate any potential liability at this time.  The Company has put into place various alternative frameworks and grounds on which to rely in order to be in compliance with relevant law for the transfer of data from overseas locations to the U.S. including reviewing Companys data collection process, procedures and putting into place Data Processing Agreements that incorporate Standard Contractual Clauses as well as supplementary measures with vendors, partners and other third parties. Some independent data regulators have adopted the position that other forms of compliance are also invalid though the legal grounds for these findings remain unclear at this time. We cannot predict at this time whether the alternative grounds that J2 Global continues to implement will be found to be consistent with relevant laws nor can we evaluate what, if any, potential liability may be at this time.  On June 28, 2018, the California legislature enacted the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and became enforceable starting July 1, 2020. The CCPA, which covers business that obtain or access personal information on California resident consumers, grants consumers enhanced privacy rights and control over their personal information and imposes significant requirements on covered companies with respect to consumer data privacy rights. The CCPA provides consumers with the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information including the requirement to include a Do Not Sell link on our websites and applications that sell personal data of California resident consumers. Based on the final implementation regulations released by the California Attorney General in August 2020, we believe we have implemented such links where necessary, we action consumer opt outs and other subject rights when requested, and our privacy policies have been updated and posted on our websites. We are continuing to evaluate the impact to our business, if any. In addition, in November 2020 California voters adopted the California Privacy Rights Act  CPRA  that amends the CCPA, including creating a new agency to implement and enforce the law. The CPRA will take effect on January 1, 2023 and is subject to a number of required rule-makings. Until that rule-making is complete, we cannot fully evaluate the impact of the CPRA on our businesses. Other states are proposing similar privacy laws and if those are passed, our Company may be subject to additional requirements and restrictions that could have an impact on our business.  Further, failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies, applicable requirements, or industry self-regulatory principles related to the collection, use, sharing, or security of personal information, or other privacy, data-retention or data protection matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us, damage to our brands, and ultimately in a loss of users and advertising partners, which could adversely affect our business. Changes in these or any other laws and regulations or the interpretation of them could increase our future compliance costs, limit the amount and type of data we can collect, transfer, share, or sell, make our products and services less attractive to our users, or cause us to change or limit our business practices. Further, any failure on our part to comply with any relevant laws or regulations may subject us to significant civil or criminal liabilities.  Moreover, our Everyday Health Group business may be subject to government oversight or regulation by Congress, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and state legislatures and regulatory agencies. In addition, certain services provided by Everyday Health Group constituent businesses are also subject to private regulation both directly by accrediting bodies and indirectly by industry codes followed by commercial supporters of CME and CE programs.  If we are subject to burdensome laws or regulations or if we fail to adhere to the requirements of public or private regulations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.  If we are unable to continue to attract visitors to our websites from search engines, then consumer traffic to our websites could decrease, which could negatively impact the sales of our products and services, our advertising revenue and the number of purchases generated for our retailers through our Digital Media marketplace.  We generate consumer traffic to our websites using various methods, including search engine marketing, or SEM, search engine optimization, or SEO, email campaigns and social media referrals. Our net revenues and profitability levels are dependent upon our continued ability to use a combination of these methods to generate consumer traffic to our websites in a cost-efficient manner. We have experienced and continue to experience fluctuations in search result rankings for a number of our websites. There can be no assurances that we will be able to grow or maintain current levels of consumer traffic.  Our SEM and SEO techniques have been developed to work with existing search algorithms utilized by the major search engines. Major search engines frequently modify their search algorithms. Changes in these algorithms could cause our websites to receive less favorable placements, which could reduce the number of users who visit our websites. In addition, we use keyword advertising to improve our search ranking and to attract users to our sites. If we fail to follow legal requirements regarding the use of keywords or search engine guidelines and policies properly, search engines may rank our content lower in search results or could remove our content altogether from their indices.  Any decline in consumer traffic to our websites could adversely impact the amount of ads that are displayed and the number of purchases we generate for our retailers, which could adversely affect our net revenues. An attempt to replace this traffic through other channels may require us to increase our sales and marketing expenditures, which would adversely affect our operating results and which may not be offset by additional net revenues.  Government and private actions or self-regulatory developments regarding internet privacy matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.  Our Digital Media business collects and sells data about its users online behavior and the revenue associated with this activity could be impacted by government regulation and enforcement, industry trends, self-regulation, technology changes, consumer behavior and attitude, and private action. We also use such information to work with our advertisers to more effectively target ads to relevant users and consumers, which ads command a higher rate.  Many of our users voluntarily provide us with demographic and other information when they register for one of our services or properties. In order for our Everyday Health Group brands to deliver marketing and communications solutions to pharmaceutical and medical device companies, health insurers, hospital systems, and other customers, we rely on data provided by our users. We also purchase data from third-party sources to augment our user profiles and marketing databases so we are better able to personalize content, enhance our analytical capabilities and better target our marketing programs. If changes in user sentiment regarding the sharing of information results in a significant number of visitors to our websites and applications refusing to provide us with information such as demographic information, information about their specific health interests, or profession information, our ability to personalize content for our users and provide targeted marketing solutions would be impaired. If our users choose to opt-out of having their data used for behavioral targeting, it would be more difficult for us to offer targeted marketing programs to our customers.  We append data from third-party sources to augment our user profiles. If we are unable to acquire data from third-party sources for whatever reason, or if there is a marked increase in the cost of obtaining such data, our ability to personalize content and provide marketing solutions could be negatively impacted.  The use of such consumer data by online service providers and advertising networks is a topic of active interest among federal, state, and international regulatory bodies, and the regulatory environment is unsettled. Federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, disclosure, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. Our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of user data are posted on our websites.  New and expanding Do Not Track regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow consumers to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. Similarly, exercise of the Do Not Sell right under the CCPA limits a business ability to monetize certain personal information collected online. The CPRA will require businesses to treat Do Not Track and other similar global privacy control browser settings as opt outs from the sale of a users personal information. These laws and regulations could have a significant impact on the operation of our advertising and data businesses. U.S. regulatory agencies have also placed an increased focus on online privacy matters and, in particular, on online advertising activities that utilizes cookies or other tracking tools. Consumer and industry groups have expressed concerns about online data collection and use by companies, which has resulted in the release of various industry self-regulatory codes of conduct and best practice guidelines that are binding for member companies and that govern, among other things, the ways in which companies can collect, use and disclose user information, how companies must give notice of these practices and what choices companies must provide to consumers regarding these practices.  We may be required or otherwise choose to adopt Do Not Track mechanisms or self-regulation principles, or provide opt-outs from the sale of certain user data, in which case our ability to use our existing tracking technologies, to collect and sell user behavioral data, and permit their use by other third parties could be impaired. This could cause our net revenues to decline and adversely affect our operating results.  U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict our ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share deidentified or anonymous data, which could increase our costs and reduce our revenue.  We operate across many different markets both domestically and internationally which may subject us to cybersecurity, privacy, data security and data protection laws with uncertain interpretations as well as impose conflicting obligations on us.  Cybersecurity, privacy, data security, and data protection laws are constantly evolving at the federal and state levels in the United States, as well as abroad. We are currently subject to such laws both at the federal and state levels in the U.S. as well as similar laws in a variety of international jurisdictions. The interpretation of these laws may be uncertain and may also impose confliction obligations on us. While we work to comply with all applicable law and relevant best practices addressing cybersecurity, privacy, data security and data protection, this is an area of the law that is constantly evolving as are the relevant industry codes and threat matrix. Further it is possible that applicable law and best practices are interpreted in an inconsistent or conflicting manner either by differing federal, state or international authorities or across the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure or perceived failure by us, our partners, our vendors, or third parties on which we rely could result in a significant liability to us  including in the form of judicial decisions and or settlements, regulatory findings and or forfeitures, and other means , cause considerable harm to us and our reputation  including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and or the media , cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  The GDPR and the CCPA impose significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to substantial risks.  The EU has traditionally imposed more strict obligations under data privacy laws and regulations. Individual EU member countries have had discretion with respect to their interpretation and implementation of EU data privacy laws, resulting in a variation of privacy standards from country to country. The GDPR harmonizes EU data privacy laws and contains significant obligations and requirements that have resulted in a greater compliance burden with respect to our operations and data use in Europe, which will continue to increase our costs. The CCPA similarly contains significant obligations and requirements that have resulted in a greater compliance burden with respect to our operations and data usage of California residents, which will continue to increase our costs. Additionally, government authorities will have more power to enforce compliance and impose substantial penalties for any failure to comply. In addition, individuals have the right to compensation under the GDPR, and individuals may have the right to file a class action under the CCPA in certain circumstances. In the event the Company fails to maintain compliance, the Company could be exposed to material damages, costs and or fines if an EU government authority, an EU resident, the California Attorney General or a California resident commenced an action. Failure to comply or maintain compliance could cause considerable harm to us and our reputation  including requiring notification to customers, regulators, and or the media , cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and deter current and potential customers from using our services. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  We face potential liability related to the privacy and security of health-related information we collect from, or on behalf of, our consumers and customers.  The privacy and security of information about the physical or mental health or condition of an individual is an area of significant focus in the U.S. because of heightened privacy concerns and the potential for significant consumer harm from the misuse of such sensitive data. We have procedures and technology in place intended to safeguard the information we receive from customers and users of our services from unauthorized access or use.  The Privacy Standards and Security Standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA  establish a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notably, whereas HIPAA previously directly regulated only these covered entities, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009  HITECH  makes certain of HIPAAs Privacy and Security Standards directly applicable to covered entities business associates. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable Privacy and Security Standards. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA.  HIPAA directly applies to covered entities such as hospital clients of certain of our subsidiaries. Since these clients disclose protected health information to our subsidiaries so that those subsidiaries can provide certain services to them, those subsidiaries are business associates of those clients. In addition, we may sign business associate agreements in connection with the provision of the products and services developed for other third parties or in connection with certain of our other services that may transmit or store protected health information.  Failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or HITECH or any of the applicable federal and state laws regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, breach notification and data security may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties or contractual liability under agreements with our customers and clients. Any failure or perception of failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA, HITECH and related regulatory requirements could expose us to risks of investigation, notification, litigation, penalty or enforcement, adversely affect demand for our products and services and force us to expend significant capital and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our clients and HIPAA and HITECH.  Developments in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.  A significant portion of Everyday Health Groups advertising and sponsorship revenues is derived from the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical, medical device, over-the-counter and consumer-packaged-goods companies, and could be affected by changes affecting healthcare spending. Industry changes affecting healthcare spending could impact the market for these offerings. General reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry participants could result from, among other things   government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which healthcare industry participants interact with consumers and the general public;  consolidation of healthcare industry participants;  reductions in governmental funding for healthcare; and  adverse changes in business or economic conditions affecting pharmaceutical and medical device companies or other healthcare industry participants.  Even if general expenditures by industry participants remain the same or increase, developments in the healthcare industry may result in reduced spending in some or all of the specific market segments that we serve now or in the future. For example, use of our content offerings and the sale of our products and services could be affected by   changes in the design and provision of health insurance plans;  a decrease in the number of new drugs or pharmaceutical and medical device products coming to market; and  decreases in marketing expenditures by pharmaceutical or medical device companies as a result of governmental regulation or private initiatives that discourage or prohibit advertising or sponsorship activities by pharmaceutical or medical device companies.  The healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes to the healthcare industry will continue to occur. However, the timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot assure you that the demand for our offerings will continue to exist at current levels or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in the healthcare industry.  Government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies with our Everyday Health Group set of brands.  The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Existing and future laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, cause us to incur additional costs and restrict our operations. Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application may not be clear. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations, or other failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could create liability for us. Even in areas where we are not subject to healthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are regulated, and participation in such actions or investigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses. Additionally, government actions, investigations, or pronouncements, or a change in self-regulatory organization rules or healthcare industry norms, might impact healthcare industry customer views of risks associated with purchasing our services and result in a reduction in their expenditures.  For example, there are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. The federal healthcare programs anti-kickback provisions prohibit any person or entity from willingly offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward, or in return for either the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service covered by these programs. Many states also have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. Our sale of advertising and sponsorships to healthcare providers implicates these laws. However, we review our practices to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws. The laws in this area are broad and we cannot determine precisely how they will be applied to our business practices. Any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our practices violate any of these laws could subject us to liability and require us to change or terminate some portions of our business.  Further, we derive revenues from the sale of advertising and promotion of prescription and over-the-counter drugs and medical devices. If the FDA or the FTC finds that any of the information provided on our properties violates FDA or FTC regulations, they may take regulatory or judicial action against us and or the advertiser of that information. State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their states consumer protection statutes. Any increase or change in regulation of  advertising and promotion in the healthcare industry could make it more difficult for us to generate and grow our advertising and sponsorship revenues.  In addition, the practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law and state laws may further prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, which is referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Similar state prohibitions may exist with respect to other licensed professions. We believe that we do not engage in the practice of medicine or any other licensed healthcare profession, or provide, through our properties, professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment or other advice that is tailored in such a way as to implicate state licensing or professional practice laws. However, a state may determine that some portion of our business violates these laws and may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us.  Our business could suffer if providers of broadband internet access services block, impair or degrade our services.  Our business is dependent on the ability of our cloud services customers and visitors to our digital media properties to access our services and applications over broadband internet connections. Internet access providers and internet backbone providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access or bandwidth use of certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users. Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet. Use of our services and applications through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a high-speed data connection. Broadband internet access services, whether wireless or landline, are provided by companies with significant market power. Many of these providers offer products and services that directly compete with ours.  Many of the largest providers of broadband services have publicly stated that they will not degrade or disrupt their customers use of applications and services, like ours. If such providers were to degrade, impair or block our services, it would negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers and likely result in lost revenue and profits, and we would incur legal fees in attempting to restore our customers access to our services. Broadband internet access providers may also attempt to charge us or our customers additional fees to access services like ours that may result in the loss of customers and revenue, decreased profitability, or increased costs to our retail offerings that may make our services less competitive.  Our business could suffer if we cannot obtain or retain numbers, are prohibited from obtaining local numbers or are limited to distributing local numbers to only certain customers.  The future success of our number-based cloud services business depends on our ability to procure large quantities of local numbers in the U.S. and foreign countries in desirable locations at a reasonable cost and offer our services to our prospective customers without restrictions. Our ability to procure and distribute numbers depends on factors such as applicable regulations, the practices of telecommunications carriers that provide numbers, the cost of these numbers and the level of demand for new numbers. For example, several years ago the FCC conditionally granted petitions by Connecticut and California to adopt specialized unified messaging area codes, but neither state has adopted such a code. Adoption of a specialized area code within a state or nation could harm our ability to compete in that state or nation if it materially affects our ability to acquire numbers for our operations or makes our services less attractive due to the unavailability of numbers with a local geographic area.  In addition, although we are the customer of record for all of our U.S. numbers, from time to time, certain U.S. telephone carriers inhibit our ability to port numbers or port our numbers away from us to other carriers. If a federal or regulatory agency determines that our customers should have the ability to port numbers without our consent, we may lose customers at a faster rate than what we have experienced historically, potentially resulting in lower revenues. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, under certain circumstances, our customers are permitted to port their numbers to another carrier. These factors could lead to increased cancellations by our Cloud Services customers and loss of our number inventory. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and growth in or entry into foreign or domestic markets.  In addition, future growth in our number-based cloud services subscriber base, together with growth in the subscriber bases of other providers of number-based services, has increased and may continue to increase the demand for large quantities of numbers, which could lead to insufficient capacity and our inability to acquire sufficient numbers to accommodate our future growth.  We may be subject to increased rates for the telecommunications services we purchase from regulated carriers which could require us to either raise the retail prices of our offerings and lose customers or reduce our profit margins.  The FCC adopted wide-ranging reforms to the system under which regulated providers of telecommunications services compensate each other for the exchange of various kinds of traffic. While we are not a provider of regulated telecommunications services, we rely on such providers to offer our cloud services to our customers. As a result of the FCCs reforms, regulated providers of telecommunications services are determining how the rates they charge customers like us will change in order to comply with the new rules. It is possible that some or all of our underlying carriers will increase the rates we pay for certain telecommunications services. Should this occur, the costs we incur to provide number-based cloud services may increase which may require us to increase the retail price of our services. Increased prices could, in turn, cause us to lose customers, or, if we do not pass on such higher costs to our subscribers, our profit margins may decrease.  New technologies have been developed that are able to block certain of our advertisements or impair our ability to serve interest-based advertising which could harm our operating results.  Technologies have been developed and are likely to continue to be developed that can block internet or mobile display advertising. Most of our Digital Media business revenues are derived from fees paid by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements or clicks on advertisements on web pages or mobile devices. As a result, such technologies and tools are reducing the number of display advertisements that we are able to deliver or our ability to serve our interest-based advertising and this, in turn, could reduce our advertising revenue and operating results. Adoption of these types of technologies by more of our users could have a material impact on our revenues. We have implemented third party products to combat these ad-blocking technologies and are developing other strategies to address advertisement blocking. However, our efforts may not be successful to offset the potential increasing impact of these advertising blocking products.  If we or our third-party service providers fail to prevent click fraud or choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, our profitability may decline.  A portion of our display revenue comes from advertisers that pay for advertising on a price-per-click basis, meaning that the advertisers pay a fee every time a user clicks on their advertising. This pricing model can be vulnerable to so-called click fraud, which occurs when clicks are submitted on ads by a user who is motivated by reasons other than genuine interest in the subject of the ad. We or our third-party service providers may be exposed to the risk of click fraud or other clicks or conversions that advertisers may perceive as undesirable. If fraudulent or other malicious activity is perpetrated by others and we or our third-party service providers are unable to detect and prevent it, or choose to manage traffic quality in a way that advertisers find unsatisfactory, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs which could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with our advertising programs and they might refuse to pay, demand refunds, or withdraw future business. Undetected click fraud could damage our brands and lead to a loss of advertisers and revenue.  The industries in which we operate are undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not be able to keep up.  The industries in which we operate are subject to rapid and significant technological change. We cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. We expect that new services and technologies will emerge in the markets in which we compete. These new services and technologies may be superior to the services and technologies that we use or these new services may render our services and technologies obsolete. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. We may be unable to obtain access to new technologies on acceptable terms or at all, and may therefore be unable to offer services in a competitive manner. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.  Risks Related To Our Stock  The fundamental change purchase features of the Convertible Notes and the change of control features of the Senior Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.  The terms of the Convertible Notes require us to offer to purchase the Convertible Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture governing the 3.25  Convertible Notes and the indenture governing the 1.75  Convertible Notes , and the terms of the Senior Notes require us to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes for cash in the event of a change of control  as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes . These features may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.  Conversions of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Convertible Notes.  The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could depress the price of our common stock.  We are a holding company and our operations are conducted through, and substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by, our subsidiaries, which are subject to certain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us to fund dividends on our stock, pay interest on the Convertible Notes and fund other holding company expenses.  We are a holding company. We conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our consolidated assets is held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends on our stock, service our debt, including the Convertible Notes and fund other holding company expenses depends on the results of operations of our subsidiaries and upon the ability of such subsidiaries to provide us with cash, whether in the form of dividends, loans or otherwise. Dividends, loans or other distributions to us from such subsidiaries could be subject to future contractual and other restrictions.  Future sales of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.  As of February 24, 2021, substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock were available for resale, subject to volume and manner of sale limitations applicable to affiliates under SEC Rule 144. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception of such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a price that we think is appropriate, or at all.  Anti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.  Provisions of Delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us. For example, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our Board of Directors. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without requiring any stockholder approval, and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders.  Our stock price may be volatile or may decline.  Our stock price and trading volumes have been volatile and we expect that this volatility will continue in the future due to factors, such as   Assessments of the size of our subscriber base and our average revenue per subscriber, and comparisons of our results in these and other areas versus prior performance and that of our competitors;  Variations between our actual results and investor expectations;  Regulatory or competitive developments affecting our markets;  Investor perceptions of us and comparable public companies;  Conditions and trends in the communications, messaging and internet-related industries;  Announcements of technological innovations and acquisitions;  Introduction of new services by us or our competitors;  Developments with respect to intellectual property rights;  Conditions and trends in the internet and other technology industries;  Rumors, gossip or speculation published on public chat or bulletin boards;  General market conditions;  Geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions; and  Global health pandemics.  In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology and other companies, particularly communications and internet companies. These broad market fluctuations have previously resulted in a material decline in the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows."}

Overview   J2 Global, Inc., together with its subsidiaries  J2 Global, the Company, our, us or we , is a leading provider of internet services. Our Digital Media business specializes in the technology, shopping, gaming, and healthcare markets, offering content, tools and services to consumers and businesses. Our Cloud Services business provides cloud-based subscription services to consumers and businesses including cloud fax, cybersecurity, privacy, and marketing technology. We manage our operations through two businesses  Digital Media and Cloud Services.  Our Digital Media business generates revenues from advertising and sponsorships, subscription and usage fees, performance marketing and licensing fees. Our Cloud Services business generates revenues primarily from customer subscription and usage fees.  In addition to growing our business organically, on a regular basis we acquire businesses to grow our customer bases, expand and diversify our service offerings, enhance our technologies, acquire skilled personnel and enter into new markets.  Our consolidated revenues are currently generated from three basic business models, each with different financial profiles and variability. Our Digital Media business is driven primarily by advertising revenues, has relatively higher sales and marketing expense and has seasonal strength in the fourth quarter. Our Cloud Services business is driven primarily by subscription revenues that are relatively higher margin, stable and predictable from quarter to quarter with minor seasonal weakness in the fourth quarter. We continue to pursue additional acquisitions, which may include companies operating under business models that differ from those we operate under today. Such acquisitions could impact our consolidated profit margins and the variability of our revenues.  J2 Global was incorporated in 2014 as a Delaware corporation through the creation of a holding company structure, and our Cloud Services business, operated by our wholly owned subsidiary, J2 Cloud Services, LLC  formerly J2 Cloud Services, Inc. , and its subsidiaries, was founded in 1995.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, and we anticipate our customers and our operations in all locations will be affected as the virus continues to proliferate and as a result of the governmental responses to the pandemic. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility and overall uncertainty. Given this disruption, volatility and uncertainty, our results may be adversely affected due to various factors affecting our performance. The Company has adjusted certain aspects of our operations to protect our employees and customers while still seeking to meet customers needs for our vital cloud internet services and digital media services.  Management is actively monitoring the global situation and will take further action to alter our operations as may be required by federal, foreign, state and local authorities or that we determine are otherwise necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. The full extent, duration and overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown and depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable. Therefore, we are continuing to assess the impact to our results of operations, financial position and liquidity based on our current assessment of the situation which could change based on the spread of the pandemic and additional government action which could limit economic activity or cause for a slower reopening of the economy.  Digital Media Performance Metrics  We use certain metrics to generally assess the operational and financial performance of our Digital Media business. The number of visits is an important metric because it is an indicator of consumers level of engagement with our mobile applications, websites and other services. We believe highly engaged consumers are more likely to participate in advertising programs and other activities that derive our multiple revenue streams.  We define a visit as a group of interactions by users with our mobile and desktop applications and websites. A single visit can contain multiple page views and actions, and a single user can open multiple visits across domains, web browsers, desktop or mobile devices. We measure visits with Google Analytics and through partner platform measures. Page views are measured each time a page on our websites is loaded in a browser.  The following table sets forth certain key operating metrics for our Digital Media business for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018  in millions    Years ended December 31,  2020 2019 2018  Visits 9,091 7,542 7,706  Page views 31,453 29,292 31,727  Sources  Google Analytics and Partner Platforms  Cloud Services Performance Metrics  We use certain metrics to generally assess the operational and financial performance of our Cloud Services business; these metrics also serve as a baseline for  a  internal trends and  b  benchmarking against competitors. The average monthly revenue per customer can be used as an analytical tool in determining the marginal economics of customer acquisition, which is particularly useful as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses. We also use this metric, in conjunction with the cancel rate, to help provide a directional indicator of Cloud Services revenue and calculate the lifetime value of customers within each of our business units.  The following table sets forth certain key operating metrics for our Cloud Services business for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018  in thousands, except for percentages    Years ended December 31,  2020 2019 2018  Subscriber revenues   Fixed   571,630   549,739   488,948  Variable 106,383 111,075 108,333  Total subscriber revenues 678,013 660,814 597,281  Other license revenues 448 1,021 694  Total revenues   678,461   661,835   597,975  Percentage of total subscriber revenues   Fixed 84.3   83.2   81.9    Variable 15.7   16.8   18.1    Total revenues   Number-based   386,899   388,334   393,079  Non-number-based 291,562 273,501 204,896  Total revenues   678,461   661,835   597,975  Average monthly revenue per Cloud Business Customer  ARPU   1  2     13.93   14.54   15.61  Cancel rate  3   2.3   2.4   2.1     1 Quarterly ARPU is calculated using our standard convention of applying the average of the quarters beginning and ending base to the total revenue for the quarter. We believe ARPU provides investors an understanding of the average monthly revenues we recognize associated with each Cloud Services customer. As ARPU varies based on fixed subscription fee and variable usage components, we believe it can serve as a measure by which investors can evaluate trends in the types of services, levels of services and the usage levels of those services across our Cloud Services customer base.   2 Cloud Services customers are defined as paying direct inward dialing numbers for fax and voice services, and direct and resellers accounts for other services.   3 Cancel Rate is defined as cancels of small and medium businesses and individual Cloud Services customers with greater than four months of continuous service  continuous service includes Cloud Services customers administratively canceled and reactivated within the same calendar month , and enterprise Cloud Services customers beginning with their first day of service. Calculated monthly and expressed as an average over the three months of the quarter.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP  and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. See Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K which describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may be material.  We believe that our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of investments, our assessment of ownership interests as variable interest entities and the related determination of consolidation, share-based compensation expense, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, long-lived and intangible asset impairment, contingent consideration, income taxes and contingencies  and allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider these policies critical because they are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Digital Media  Digital Media revenues are earned primarily from the delivery of advertising services and from subscriptions to services and information.  Revenue is earned from the delivery of advertising services on the Companys owned and operated websites and on those websites that are part of Digital Medias advertising network. Depending on the individual contracts with the customer, revenue for these services are recognized over the contract period when any of the following performance obligations are satisfied   i  when an advertisement is placed for viewing;  ii  when a qualified sales lead is delivered;  iii  when a visitor clicks through on an advertisement; or  iv  when commissions are earned upon the sale of an advertised product.  Revenue from subscriptions is earned through the granting of access to, or delivery of, certain data products or services to customers. Subscriptions cover video games and related content, health information, data and other copyrighted material. Revenues under such agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the service. Revenues are also earned from listing fees, subscriptions to online publications, and from other sources. Subscription revenues are recognized over time.  J2 Global also generates Digital Media revenues through the license of certain assets to clients. Assets are licensed for clients use in their own promotional materials or otherwise. Such assets may include logos, editorial reviews, or other copyrighted material. Revenues under such license agreements are recognized over the contract term for use of the asset. Technology assets are also licensed to clients. These assets are recognized over the term of the access period. The Digital Media business also generates revenue from other sources which had included marketing and production services. Such other revenues are generally recognized over the period in which the products or services are delivered.  J2 Global also generates Digital Media revenues from transactions involving the sale of perpetual software licenses, related software support and maintenance, hardware used in conjunction with its software, and other related services. Revenue is recognized for these software transactions with multiple performance obligations after  i  the Company has had an approved contract and is committed to perform the respective obligations and  ii  the Company can identify and quantify each obligation and its respective selling price. Once the respective performance obligations have been identified and quantified, revenue will be recognized when the obligations are met, either over time or at a point in time depending on the nature of the obligation.  Revenues from software license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time that the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues for related software support and maintenance performance obligations are related to technical support provided to customers as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period when they are available. The Company is obligated to make the support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period the support services are provided. Hardware product and related software performance obligations, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a bundled performance obligation. The revenues for this bundled performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware and software products are delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer. Other service revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed.  The Company records revenue on a gross basis with respect to revenue generated  i  by the Company serving online display and video advertising across its owned and operated web properties, on third-party sites or on unaffiliated advertising networks;  ii  through the Companys lead-generation business; and  iii  through the Companys subscriptions. The Company records revenue on a net basis with respect to revenue paid to the Company by certain third-party advertising networks who serve online display and video advertising across the Companys owned-and-operated web properties and certain third-party sites.  Cloud Services  The Companys Cloud Services revenues substantially consist of monthly recurring subscription and usage-based fees, the majority of which are paid in advance by credit card. The Company defers the portions of monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annually recurring subscription and usage-based fees collected in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations and recognizes them in the period earned.  Along with our numerous proprietary Cloud Services solutions, the Company also generates revenues by reselling various third-party solutions, primarily through our email security and online backup lines of business. These third-party solutions, along with our proprietary products, allow the Company to offer customers a variety of solutions to better meet the customers needs. The Company records revenue on a gross basis with respect to reseller revenue because the Company has control of the specified good or service prior to transferring control to the customer.  Valuation and Impairment of Investments  We account for our investments in debt securities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  ASC Topic No. 320, Investments - Debt Securities  ASC 320 . Our debt investments are typically comprised of corporate debt securities, which we classify as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income. All debt securities are accounted for on a specific identification basis.  The Companys available-for-sale debt securities are carried at an estimated fair value with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. Available-for-sale debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in loss on investments, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated comprehensive loss in stockholders equity.  We account for our investments in equity securities in accordance with ASC Topic No. 321, Investments - Equity Securities  ASC 321  which requires the accounting for equity investments  other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting  generally be measured at fair value for equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value that are not accounted for by the equity method, we measure the equity security using cost, less impairment, if any, and plus or minus observable price changes arising from orderly transactions in the same or similar investment from the same issuer. Any unrealized gains or losses will be reported in current earnings  see Note 5 - Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference .  We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on an investment has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions  see Note 5 - Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference .  Variable Interest Entities  VIE   A VIE requires consolidation by the entitys primary beneficiary. We evaluate our investments in entities in which we are involved to determine if the entity is a VIE and if so, whether we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we hold a variable interest in our investment as a limited partner in the OCV Fund I, LP  OCV Fund, OCV or the Fund . In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, both of the following characteristics must be present   a  the Company has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the VIEs economic performance  the power criterion ; and  b  the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE, or the right to receive benefits of the VIE, that could potentially be significant to the VIE  the economic criterion .  We have concluded that, as a limited partner, although the obligations to absorb losses or the right to benefit from the gains is not insignificant, we do not have power over OCV because we do not have the ability to direct the significant decisions which impact the economics of OCV. We believe that the OCV general partner, as a single decision maker, holds the ability to make the decisions about the activities that most significantly impact the OCV Funds economic performance. As a result, we have concluded that we will not consolidate OCV, as we are not the primary beneficiary of the OCV Fund, and will account for this investment under the equity-method of accounting. See Note 5, Investments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.  OCV qualifies as an investment company under ASC 946 - Financial Services, Investment Companies  ASC 946 . Under ASC Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, an investor that holds investments that qualify for specialized industry accounting for investment companies in accordance with ASC 946 should record its share of the earnings or losses, realized or unrealized, as reported by its equity method investees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  We recognize our equity in the net earnings or losses relating to the investment in OCV on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If we become aware of a significant decline in value that is other-than-temporary, the loss will be recorded in the period in which we identify the decline.  Share-Based Compensation Expense  We account for share-based awards to employees and non-employees in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation  ASC 718 . Accordingly, we measure share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the expense over the employees requisite service period using the straight-line method. The measurement of share-based compensation expense is based on several criteria including, but not limited to, the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate, dividend rate and award cancellation rate. These inputs are subjective and are determined using managements judgment. If differences arise between the assumptions used in determining share-based compensation expense and the actual factors, which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future share-based compensation expense. Any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter. The Company estimates the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees.  Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived and Intangible Assets  J2 Global accounts for long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives  subject to amortization , in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic No. 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment  ASC 360 , which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected undiscounted future net cash flows generated by the asset. If it is determined that the asset may not be recoverable, and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference.  We assess the impairment of identifiable definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include the following   Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;  Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;  Significant negative industry or economic trends;  Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and  Our market capitalization relative to net book value.  If we determined that the carrying value of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.  We have assessed whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying amount of definite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairments of certain operating right-of-use assets and associated property and equipment  see Note 11 - Leases of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference . No impairment was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018.  The Company classifies its long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period  i  it has approved and committed to a plan to sell the asset,  ii  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition,  iii  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to sell the asset have been initiated,  iv  the sale of the asset is probable,  v  the asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and  vi  it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a long-lived asset until the date of sale. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, the Company stops recording depreciation expense on the asset. The Company assesses the fair value of a long-lived asset less any costs to sell at each reporting period and until the asset is no longer classified as held for sale.  Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  We apply the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP and uses estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired. Such estimates may be based on significant unobservable inputs and assumptions such as, but not limited to, revenue growth rates, gross margins, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and terminal growth rate assumptions. We use established valuation techniques and may engage reputable valuation specialists to assist with the valuations. Managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting are recorded at the estimated fair value of the assets acquired. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of purchased customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, developed technologies and other intangible assets. Intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the period of estimated economic benefit ranging from one to 20 years and are included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment pursuant to FASB ASC Topic No. 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  ASC 350 , which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. In connection with the annual impairment test for goodwill, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether it  is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the impairment test upon goodwill. The impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values, including goodwill. We generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach methodology of valuation. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. In 2020, we changed the annual goodwill impairment assessment date for the Digital Media business from December 31 to October 1, as we determined this date is preferable, and concluded this was not a material change in accounting principle.  Contingent Consideration  Certain of our acquisition agreements include contingent earn-out arrangements, which are generally based on the achievement of future income thresholds or other metrics. The contingent earn-out arrangements are based upon our valuations of the acquired companies and reduce the risk of overpaying for acquisitions if the projected financial results are not achieved.  The fair values of these earn-out arrangements are included as part of the purchase price of the acquired companies on their respective acquisition dates. For each transaction, we estimate the fair value of contingent earn-out payments as part of the initial purchase price and record the estimated fair value of contingent consideration as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We consider several factors when determining that contingent earn-out liabilities are part of the purchase price, including the following   1  the valuation of our acquisitions is not supported solely by the initial consideration paid, and the contingent earn-out formula is a critical and material component of the valuation approach to determining the purchase price; and  2  the former shareholders of acquired companies that remain as key employees receive compensation other than contingent earn-out payments at a reasonable level compared with the compensation of our other key employees. The contingent earn-out payments are not affected by employment termination.  We measure our contingent earn-out liabilities in connection with acquisitions at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy  see Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference . We may use various valuation techniques depending on the terms and conditions of the contingent consideration including a Monte-Carlo simulation. This simulation uses probability distribution for each significant input to produce hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes and the results are analyzed to determine probabilities of different outcomes occurring. Significant increases or decreases to these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower liability with a higher liability capped by the contractual maximum of the contingent earn-out obligation. Ultimately, the liability will be equivalent to the amount paid, and the difference between the fair value estimate and amount paid will be recorded in earnings. The amount paid that is less than or equal to the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amount paid in excess of the liability on the acquisition date is reflected as cash used in operating activities.  We review and re-assess the estimated fair value of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis, and the updated fair value could be materially different from the initial estimates or prior quarterly amounts. Changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent earn-out liabilities and adjustments to the estimated fair value related to changes in all other unobservable inputs are reported in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Income Taxes  Our income is subject to taxation in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or lapse of a statute of limitations. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.  We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes  ASC 740 , which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. GAAP also requires that deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time. In assessing this valuation allowance, we review historical and future expected operating results and other factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.  federal and state  and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions  including integrations  and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted the 2017 Tax Act. Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.  Income Tax Contingencies  We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the following year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent year.  ASC 740 provides guidance on the minimum threshold that an uncertain income tax position is required to meet before it can be recognized in the financial statements and applies to all tax positions taken by a company. ASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the income tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50  likely of being realized upon settlement. If it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain income tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate uncertain income tax positions and establish or release reserves as appropriate under GAAP.  As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions, and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to managements assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. Therefore, the actual liability for U.S. or foreign taxes may be  materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. In addition, we may be subject to examination of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service  IRS  and other domestic and foreign tax authorities.  Non-Income Tax Contingencies  We do not collect and remit sales and use, telecommunication, or similar taxes in certain jurisdictions where we believe that such taxes are not applicable or legally required. Several states and other taxing jurisdictions have presented or threatened us with assessments, alleging that we are required to collect and remit such taxes there.  We are currently under audit or is subject to audit for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. We have a  22.5 million reserve established for these matters which is included in other long-term liabilities and accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. It is reasonably possible that additional liabilities could be incurred resulting in additional expense, which could have a materially impact on our financial results.  Allowances for Doubtful Accounts  We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We assess collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectability based on past due status. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 2, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectations of their impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  Results of Operations  Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018  Digital Media  We expect revenue for fiscal year 2021 to be higher compared to the prior-year due to the acquisition of RetailMeNot, subject to the continued risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect the Digital Media business to improve as we integrate our recent acquisitions and over the longer term as advertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online, but these initiatives will be offset by the impact of COVID-19 in the near term. The main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to visitors to our websites and those included within our advertising networks, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and those included within our advertising networks.  The operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our websites is significantly higher than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from those placed on third-party websites. Growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from third-party websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the trend in advertising spend is shifting to mobile devices and other newer advertising formats which generally experience lower margins than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to put pressure on our margins.  We expect acquisitions to remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital in this business; however, we cannot predict whether our current pace of acquisitions will remain the same within this business, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or  acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods. Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this space but with different business models may impact Digital Medias overall profit margins.  Cloud Services  Given the uncertainty of the current macroeconomic environment and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect 2021 revenue to be higher compared to the prior-year. The main focus of our Cloud Services offerings is to reduce or eliminate costs, increase sales and enhance productivity, mobility, business continuity and security of our customers as the technologies and devices they use evolve over time. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to enhance our existing offerings and offer new services to continue to satisfy the evolving needs of our customers.  We expect acquisitions to remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital in this business; however, we cannot predict whether our current pace of acquisitions will remain the same within this business, especially in light of the current macroeconomic conditions. In a given period, we may close greater or fewer acquisitions than in prior periods or acquisitions of greater or lesser significance than in prior periods. Moreover, future acquisitions of businesses within this space but with different business models may impact Cloud Services overall profit margins. Also, as IP licensing often involves litigation, the timing of licensing transactions is unpredictable and can and does vary significantly from period to period. This variability can cause the overall businesss financial results to materially vary from period to period.  J2 Global Consolidated  Based on the trends discussed above with respect to our Cloud Services and Digital Media businesses, we anticipate our consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2021 to be higher compared to the prior-year comparable period.  We expect operating profit as a percentage of revenues to generally decrease in the future primarily due to the fact that revenue with respect to our Digital Media business  i  is increasing as a percentage of our revenue on a consolidated basis and  ii  has historically operated at a lower operating margin.  The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, information derived from our Statements of Operations as a percentage of revenues. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cloud Services revenues primarily consist of revenues from fixed customer subscription revenues and variable revenues generated from actual usage of our services. We also generate Cloud Services revenues from IP licensing.  Our revenues have increased over the past three years primarily due to a combination of acquisitions and organic growth; partially offset by declines in certain areas of both the Digital Media and Cloud Services businesses.

Interest expense, net was  132.0 million,  69.5 million, and  62.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to increased interest expense associated with the issuance of our 1.75  Convertible Senior Notes in the fourth quarter 2019; and the payment of certain prepayment penalties and write off of issuance costs in connection with the refinancing of our 6.0  Senior Notes and associated issuance of our 4.625  Senior Notes in the fourth quarter 2020. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to increased interest expense associated with our line of credit borrowings and issuance of our 1.75  Convertible Senior Notes in the fourth quarter 2019.  Gain on sale of businesses. Our gain on sale of businesses is generated primarily from the sale of certain Voice assets in Australia and New Zealand in the third quarter of 2020. Gain on sale of businesses was  17.1 million, zero, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Loss on investments, net.

Our net loss on investments, net increased during fiscal year 2020 versus the prior comparable period due to net losses realized on certain investments as the result of the recapitalization of the investee and overall market volatility. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was attributable to an impairment loss on equity securities.  Other  income  expense, net. Our other  income  expense, net is generated primarily from miscellaneous items and gain or losses on currency exchange. Other  income  expense, net was   31.6  million,  3.7 million, and  4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change from 2019 to 2020 was attributable to currency exchange gains. The change from 2018 to 2019 was attributable to currency exchange losses.  Income Taxes  Our effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax regulations  including those related to transfer pricing  and different tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize. When necessary, we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.  As of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards  NOLs  of  60.2 million after considering substantial restrictions on the utilization of these NOLs due to ownership changes, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We estimate that all of the above-mentioned federal NOLs will be available for use before their expiration.  59.7 million of the NOLs expire through the year 2037 and  0.5 million of the NOLs carry forward indefinitely depending on the year the loss was incurred.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has no foreign tax credit carryovers. In addition, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had available unrecognized state research and development tax credits of  9.1 million and  3.2 million, respectively, which last indefinitely.  Income tax expense  benefit  amounted to  68.4 million,   19.4  million and  44.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rates for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 29.7 ,  9.7   and 25.2 , respectively.  The increase in our annual effective income tax rate from 2019 to 2020 was primarily attributable to the following   1.An increase in tax expense during 2020 due to a  53.7 million tax benefit recognized in 2019 from an intra-entity transfer as part of the reorganization of our international operating structure resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset with no comparable event during 2020; and  2.a decrease in the benefit for the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the U.S.  relative to income from U.S. domestic operations ; and  3.an increase in tax expense during 2020 due to recording valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers.  The decrease in our annual effective income tax rate from 2018 to 2019 was primarily attributable to the following   1.a decrease during 2019 from an intra-entity transfer as part of the reorganization of our international operating structure resulting in recognition of a  53.7 million tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset; and  2.a decrease in tax expense during 2019 from an overall reduction in our net reserve for uncertain tax positions; partially offset by  3.a decrease in the benefit for the portion of our income being taxed in foreign jurisdictions and subject to lower tax rates than in the U.S.  relative to income from U.S. domestic operations .  In order to provide additional understanding in connection with our foreign taxes, the following represents the statutory and effective tax rate by significant foreign country   Ireland United Kingdom Canada  Statutory tax rate 12.5  19.0  26.5   Effective tax rate  1   10.6  19.2  26.7    1  Effective tax rate excludes certain discrete items.  The statutory tax rate is the rate imposed on taxable income for corporations by the local government in that jurisdiction. The effective tax rate measures the taxes paid as a percentage of pretax profit. The effective tax rate can differ from the statutory tax rate when a company can exempt some income from tax, claim tax credits, or due to the effect of book-tax differences that do not reverse and discrete items.  Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. We believe our tax positions, including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Certain of these tax positions have in the past been, and are currently being, challenged, and this may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate if our tax reserves are insufficient.  Equity Method Investment  Net loss in earnings of equity method investment. Net loss in earnings of equity method investment is generated from our investment in the OCV Fund for which we receive annual audited financial statements. The investment in the OCV Fund is presented net of tax and on a one-quarter lag due to the timing and availability of financial information from OCV. If the Company becomes aware of a significant decline in value that is other-than-temporary, the loss will be recorded in the period in which the Company identifies the decline.  The net loss in earnings of equity method investment was  11.3 million,  0.2 million and  4.1 million, net of tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The fiscal 2020 loss was primarily a result of the impairment of two of the OCV Funds investments as a result of COVID-19 in the amount of  7.0 million, net of tax benefit. In addition, the Company recognized an investment loss in fiscal 2020 in the amount of  4.3 million, net of tax benefit. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company recognized management fees of  3.0 million,  3.0 million and  4.5 million, net of tax benefit, respectively.  Digital Media and Cloud Services Results  Our businesses are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance and have been aggregated into two businesses   i  Digital Media; and  ii  Cloud Services.  We evaluate the performance of our businesses based on revenues, including both external and interbusiness net sales, and operating income. We account for interbusiness sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the businesses. Identifiable assets by business are those assets used in the respective businesses operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant interbusiness amounts are eliminated to arrive at our consolidated financial results.  Digital Media  The following results are presented for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018  in thousands    2020 2019 2018  External net sales   811,589   710,811   609,434  Inter-business net sales  229   300   60   Net sales 811,360 710,511 609,374  Cost of revenues 77,473 93,053 78,919  Gross profit 733,887 617,458 530,455  Operating expenses 594,087 540,193 483,167  Operating income   139,800   77,265   47,288  Net sales of  811.4 million in 2020 increased  100.8 million, or 14.2 , and net sales of  710.5 million in 2019 increased  101.1 million, or 16.6 , from the prior comparable period primarily due to business acquisitions subsequent to the prior comparable periods.  Gross profit of  733.9 million in 2020 increased  116.4 million and gross profit of  617.5 million in 2019 increased  87.0 million from the prior comparable periods primarily due to an increase in net sales between the periods. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues in 2020 and 2019 was higher due to lower content fees, campaign fulfillment cost, other editorial and production costs. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues in 2019 and 2018 was consistent with the previous comparable period.  Operating expenses of  594.1 million in 2020 increased  53.9 million from the prior comparable period primarily due to additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to 2019 comprised primarily of salary and related costs including severance and an increase in marketing costs. Operating expenses of  540.2 million in 2019 increased  57.0 million from the prior comparable period primarily due to additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to 2018 comprised primarily of salary and related costs, marketing costs and changes in fair value of contingent consideration and amortization of intangible assets.  As a result of these factors, operating income of  139.8 million in 2020 increased  62.5 million, or 80.9 , from 2019, and operating income of  77.3 million in 2019 increased  30.0 million, or 63.4 , from 2018.

Gross profit of  524.2 million in 2020 increased  6.6 million from 2019 and gross profit of  517.6 million in 2019 increased  41.7 million from 2018 primarily due to an increase in net sales from acquisitions between the periods. The gross profit as a percentage of revenues for 2020 and 2019 was consistent with the previous comparable period.  Operating expenses of  275.0 million in 2020 increased  5.0 million from 2019 and was consistent with the previous comparable period. Operating expenses of  270.0 million in 2019 increased  30.4 million from 2018 primarily due to  a  additional expense associated with businesses acquired in and subsequent to the prior comparable period; and  b  an increase in marketing costs and amortization of intangible assets.  As a result of these factors, operating earnings of  249.2 million in 2020 increased  1.7 million, or 0.7 , from 2019, and operating earnings of  247.5 million in 2019 increased  11.3 million, or 4.8 , from 2018. Our Cloud Services business consists of several services which have similar economic characteristics, including the nature of the services and their production processes, the type of customers, as well as the methods used to distribute these services.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments  At December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of  340.8 million compared to  675.7 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and investments resulted primarily from the repayment of debt, business acquisitions, repurchase of common stock, purchases of property and equipment and investments; partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of debt, cash provided from operations and proceeds from the sale of businesses. At December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents, and investments consisted of cash and cash equivalents of  242.7 million, short-term investments of  0.7 million, and long-term investments of  97.5 million. Our investments consist of equity and debt securities. For financial statement presentation, we classify our debt securities primarily as short- and long-term based upon their maturity dates. Short-term investments mature within one year of the date of the financial statements and long-term investments mature one year or more from the date of the financial statements. As of December 31, 2020 cash, cash equivalents, and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were  240.5 million and  100.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 cash, cash equivalents, and investments held within domestic and foreign jurisdictions were  604.7 million and  71.0 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately  259.7 million primarily due to cash outflows of  662.9 million related to business combinations and share repurchases during the second half of 2020. In addition, the 3.25  Convertible Notes in the amount of  396.8 million are recorded as a current liability as of December 31, 2020 due to the Holders right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or part of their 3.25  Convertible Notes on June 15, 2021. However, due to the fact that the Convertible Notes are trading well above par, management has determined that the likelihood that the Holders will exercise this right is remote.  On October 7, 2020, the Company issued  750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625  Senior Notes due 2030. A portion of the proceeds were used to fund the redemption of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.0  Senior Notes previously issued by one of our subsidiaries and to pay the redemption premium due in respect of such redemption and accrued and unpaid interest. The company expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including acquisitions. Subsequent to the year end, the Company is pursuing to reestablish a credit facility at the J2 Global, Inc. level providing borrowings of  100.0 million expandable, subject to certain conditions, to  350.0 million.  The Companys Board of Directors approved two quarterly cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2019, totaling  0.900 per share of common stock. Future dividends are subject to Board approval. However, based on the significant number of current investment opportunities within the Companys portfolio of businesses and the historic returns from prior investments, the Board of Directors suspended dividend payments for the foreseeable future after the June 4, 2019 payment.  On January 7, 2019, J2 Cloud Services, LLC entered into a Credit Agreement  the Credit Agreement  with certain lenders from time to time party thereto  collectively, the Lenders  and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as sole lead arranger and as administrative agent for the Lenders  the Agent . On October 7, 2020, the Company terminated the Credit Agreement. On November 15, 2019, the Company issued  550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75  Convertible Notes and received net proceeds of  537.1 million in cash, net of initial purchasers discounts, commissions and other debt issuance costs. A portion of the net proceeds were used pay off all amounts then outstanding under the MUFG Credit Facility, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions.  On June 10, 2014, J2 Global issued  402.5 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25  convertible senior notes due June 15, 2029  the 3.25  Convertible Notes . During the fourth quarter of 2020, the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock exceeded 130  of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days  ending on, and including, the last trading day of the quarter. As a result, the 3.25  Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the holder during the quarter beginning January 1, 2021 and ending March 31, 2021. Since the Company currently intends to settle the principal amount in cash, the net carrying amount of the 3.25  Convertible Notes is classified within current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020.  On September 25, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Companys entry into a commitment to invest  200 million in an investment fund  the Fund  over several years at a fairly ratable rate. The manager, OCV Management, LLC  OCV , and general partner of the Fund are entities with respect to which Richard S. Ressler, Chairman of the Board of Directors  the Board  of the Company, is indirectly the majority equity holder. As a limited partner in the Fund, the Company will pay an annual management fee to the manager equal to 2.0   reduced by 10  each year beginning with the sixth year  of capital commitments. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Funds limited partnership agreement, once the Company has received distributions equal to its invested capital, the Funds general partner will be entitled to a carried interest equal to 20 . The Fund has a six year investment period, subject to certain exceptions. The commitment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board in accordance with the Companys related-party transaction approval policy.  During 2020, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC for  32.9 million, inclusive of certain management fees, of which  31.9 million has been paid for the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2019, the Company received a distribution from OCV of  10.3 million. During 2019, the Company received capital call notices from the management of OCV Management, LLC for  29.6 million inclusive of certain management fees, of which  29.6 million has been paid for the year ended December 31, 2019.  We currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital, capital expenditure, investment requirements, stock repurchases and cash dividends for at least the next 12 months.  Cash Flows  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents. Net cash provided by operating activities was  480.1 million,  412.5 million and  401.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our operating cash flows resulted primarily from cash received from our customers offset by cash payments we made to third parties for their services, employee compensation and interest payments associated with our debt. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, increased income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions. The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments; partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, higher tax payments, lower uncertain tax positions and reduced deferred revenue. Our prepaid tax payments were  3.0 million and  3.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were  243.3 million,  575.6 million and  209.5 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Net cash used in investing activities was  586.2 million,  505.3 million and  406.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and the purchase of equity method investments; partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of businesses. Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to business acquisitions, capital expenditures associated with the purchase of property and equipment and purchases of equity method investments; partially offset by the distribution from an equity method investment.  Net cash  used in  provided by financing activities was   234.6  million,  456.7 million and   131.4  million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities in 2020 was primarily attributable to the repayment of debt, repurchase of stock and business acquisitions; partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of our 4.625  Senior Notes and exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of 1.75  Convertible Notes, proceeds from the line of credit and exercise of stock options; partially offset by payment of the line of credit, dividends paid, repurchase of stock, business acquisitions and repayment of note payable.  Stock Repurchase Program  In February 2012, the Companys Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of our common stock through February 20, 2013 which was subsequently extended through February 20, 2021.  In July 2016, the Company acquired and subsequently retired 935,231 shares of J2 Global common stock in connection with the acquisition of Integrated Global Concepts, Inc. As a result of the purchase of J2 Global common stock, the Companys Board of Directors approved a reduction in the number of shares available for purchase under the 2012 Program by the same amount.  During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 1,140,819 and 197,870 shares under this program, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, all of the available shares were repurchased under the 2012 Program at an aggregate cost of  204.6 million  including an immaterial amount of commission fees .  On August 6, 2020, the Companys Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of up to ten million shares of our common stock through August 6, 2025  the 2020 Program  in addition to the five million shares repurchased under the 2012 Program. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 2,490,599 shares at an aggregate cost of  177.8 million  including an immaterial amount of commission fees  under the 2020 Program, which were subsequently retired.  As a result of the Companys share repurchase programs, the number of shares available for purchase is 7,509,401 shares of J2 Global common stock.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We are not party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1. Business  Overview   Pareteum Corporation  OTC  TEUM  is a rapidly growing cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every Thing  .  Millions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteums global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteums goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things  IoT , and telecommunications infrastructure providers.  With estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteums cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.  The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners  whose technologies are integrated into our cloud  include  Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.  Pareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower Every Person and Every Thing  to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggretators  MVNO, MVNE and MVNA , Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service  CPaaS , which Pareteum delivers.  Coronavirus Pandemic  In March 2020, the novel coronavirus  COVID-19  began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States  U.S.  declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results  the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect operating and financial results to continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.  We have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.  Innovative Use Cases  Many sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Companys platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others    Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.   Connected cars   Smart cities   Smart logistics and supply chains   Smart healthcare applications  In addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios  the Acquired IP Rights , which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.  Business Model  At Pareteum, our mission is to Empower Consumer Service Providers  CSPs , Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity. We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.  However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a network effect. The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.  To achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering Mobility, Engagement, Intelligence and Control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.  Go-to-Market and Growth Strategy  Pareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the recent Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.  Pareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.  Our go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach   Phase 1  Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.  Phase 2  Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions  North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific .  Phase 3  Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more things  whether Subscriber Identification Module  SIM  cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.  to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market  including in developing markets .  Phase 4  At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.  The phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the worlds shift to an open mobility and application network. When were successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.  We also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas    Exploring cross and up-sale opportunities among Pareteums recent customer acquisitions - focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;   Platform evolution - enhance and expand existing products and services; and   Geographic expansion-focusing on entering new markets such as South East Asia and Latin America.  Employees  As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 218 full and part-time employees worldwide.  Research   Development  Pareteums research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were  12.8 million and  3.1 million, respectively.  Intellectual Property  Pareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has two granted patents for inventions embedded in its communications platforms, and with the addition of Artilium and iPass has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking and systems and methods for network curation, all expiring throughout 2034, and subject to renewals.  Pareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.  Sales   Marketing  Pareteums sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.  We engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.  Customers  Our customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.  A customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of handoff from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  Pareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24x7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteums customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.  The Company has a significant customer and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, this significant customer accounted for approximately 20  and 64  of our revenues.  Competition  We compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services  including consulting, systems integration and managed services , software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services  such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus  and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.  We believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including    the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;   the price at which others offer competitive software and services;   the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;   the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;   the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;   the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and   the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.  A number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.  The CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be    Scale and international reach of connectivity   Comprehensiveness of platform offerings   Ease of deployment and implementation   Scalability and reliability of service  Pareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes    Mobile Virtual Network Enabler  MVNE  services for CSPs  In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.   Wi-Fi Connectivity aggregation for Enterprise customers  Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.   Short Message Service Application-To-Person  SMS A2P  messaging for Enterprise customers  Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable B2C messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface  API  integration.   IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers  Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.  Nevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.  One key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example    Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.   Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure  e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.   Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.   One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine  M2M  services  through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile  GSM  communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.  Regulatory  Pareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.  Privacy and Data Protection  The regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.  Because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.  Any failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments, policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions  especially the European Union , enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.  Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate, have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including but not limited to the European Union  EU , the United Kingdom  UK  and Switzerland. The EUs and UKs data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , which went into effect back in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, UK and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of EU, UK and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR  and its UK equivalent commonly referred to as UK GDPR  regulates transfers of personal data  subject to such laws  from the European Economic Area  EEA  and the UK to the U.S. as well as other third countries outside EEA and the UK which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-US Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to the US, creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and UK GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the UK including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to US-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects  for example, the right to be forgotten , increased data portability for EU and UK consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4  of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPRs and UK GDPRs requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and UK data protection regulators under GDPR and UK GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and UK GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.  On January 31, 2020, the UK ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as Brexit. Following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EUs trade agreements. Effective from 1 January 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the UK and the EU, as it existed before 31 December 2020, ended and the EU and the UK now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges  including data  that did not exist prior to 31 December 2020.  Even though the UK reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement  TCA  and related documents, and the UK government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws  including the implementation of GDPR into UK law  now commonly referred to as UK GDPR  that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from 1 January 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the UKs relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the UKs new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the UK and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the UK, the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.  Additionally, now that the UK and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the UK and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and or operational implications for our business which involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.  Although the current arrangements between the EU and UK permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from 1 January 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether UK is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the UK not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws  and related guidance  between the UK and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the UK and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.  Non-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and UK GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about US data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.  U.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.  Because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.  Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, contractual obligations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and have a material and adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, contractual obligations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our services. Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our services, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to the Internet, our business may be harmed.  Telecommunications Regulations  Currently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.

Financial Information About Segments  The Company has three operating segments, Legacy Pareteum, Artilium and iPass, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our chief operating decision-maker  CODM  manages segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions, and for which discrete financial information is available. The CODM assesses performance of the Companys major lines of business, MVNO, MVNE, Messaging, and Enterprise  Business Lines , based on revenues, however the lowest level of discrete financial information, including revenues, cost of sales, gross margin and earnings, is at the primary business units, which represent the Companys operating segments. The CODM makes resource allocation decisions, primarily regarding the number of employees allocated, based on revenues, gross margin, earnings and cash flows on a consolidated basis. The CODM is not provided and does not use asset information when making operating decisions, assessing performance, or allocating resources. For additional information regarding our reportable segment, see Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition and Reporting Segment in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1A. Risk Factors  An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all of your investment.  Risks Related to Our Business  The restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K A and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, stockholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.  On October 21, 2019, our board of directors determined that the Companys financial statements that were included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019  collectively, the Non-Reliance Periods  should no longer be relied upon. Similarly, related press releases, earnings releases, and investor communications describing the Companys financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods should no longer be relied upon. The Company restated its financial statements for a portion of the Non-Reliance Periods in the previously filed amendments to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K A. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods in 2019.  As a result of these restatements and associated non-reliance on previously issued financial information, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we have become subject to, and could also be subject to additional, stockholder, governmental, regulatory or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of managements time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our customers, stockholders, or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In connection with the restatement of our financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods, our management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Further, management determined that control deficiencies existed with respect to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting and, accordingly, management has concluded that managements reports related to the effectiveness of internal and disclosure controls may not have been correct. As a result, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price are possible.  Our business may be adversely impacted by risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in a global economic downturn. As a response to the spread of COVID-19 many countries, including the U.S., Great Britain and other jurisdictions in Europe, South America and the Middle East where we have employees, have been taking measures designated to limit the continued spread of COVID-19, including the closure of workplaces, restricting travel, prohibiting assembling, closing international borders and quarantining populated areas. Governments around the world have passed temporary emergency orders requiring all residents to remain in their homes along with limitations on which businesses are allowed to remain open and the number of workers allowed at each site. Although many of these orders have been partially lifted in certain jurisdictions, the effects of these indefinite travel restrictions and alternative working arrangements are unknown, may negatively impact the productivity of our employee base, and may have a negative effect on our sales and operations functions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  While the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown at this time, we are closely monitoring the developments and continually assessing the potential impact on our business. Our business may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak due to the following risks, any of which may lead to an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations    a number of our employees may be infected and or subject to quarantine periods and may be unable to perform their duties and our offices may be forced to operate with a reduced workforce and or be forced to close under the temporary emergency regulations. This may lead to ineffective control over our business and a lower work efficiency, productivity and financial performance;   a reduced workforce, lack of international travel, and few face-to-face meetings with customers and potential customers may adversely affect our operations;   we may experience difficulties in collecting amounts due from customers, including major customers, due to a downturn in their financial condition; and   due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees have moved to work from their homes and remotely access our IT networks. Such remote working mode creates the risk of attacking the end-point user stations, connection channels and gateways. These potential breaches of our security measures may harm our business.  Historically, a significant portion of our sales were conducted in person. Currently, as a result of the work and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, substantially all of our sales and professional services activities are being conducted remotely. As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not yet know the extent of the negative impact on our ability to attract, serve or retain customers. Furthermore, as a result of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as general economic uncertainty and associated macroeconomic conditions, existing and potential customers may choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, or attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, which may materially and negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and prospects. This could result in reductions in sales of our platform and services, longer sales cycles, reductions in subscription duration and value, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Any of these events could harm our business and operating results. In addition, there can be no assurance that cloud-based collaborative work management and productivity spending levels will increase following any recovery, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  The number of companies whose employees are working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting government-ordered shutdowns has caused use of our platform to increase. If our data centers are unable to keep up with this increased usage, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service, which could result in the loss of customers who use our communications platform because of its reliability and performance, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Our independent auditors report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our independent registered public accounting firms report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains a paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the documents governing our convertible financing for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations. To access capital to fund operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under our outstanding convertible note, we may need to restructure our convertible indebtedness and raise capital in one or more debt and or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the suspension of trading of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. For these reasons, the audit report of our independent registered public accountants on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 contains an explanatory paragraph stating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The current economic climate, especially in Europe, may have an adverse effect in the markets in which we operate.  Much of our customers business is consumer driven, and to the extent there is a decline in consumer spending, our customers could experience a reduction in the demand for their services and consequently affect the demand for our services and a decrease in our revenues, net income and an increase in bad debts arising from non-payment of our trade receivables. The potential adverse effects of an economic downturn include    reduced demand for services, resulting in increased price competition or deferrals of purchases, with lower revenues not fully compensated through reduced costs;   risk of financial difficulties or failures among our suppliers;   increased demand for customer finance, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable and increased risk of counterparty default;   risk of impairment losses related to our intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of certain products;   increased difficulties in forecasting sales and financial results as well as increased volatility in our reported results; and   end-user demand could also be adversely affected by reduced consumer spending on technology, changed operator pricing, security breaches and trust issues.  Uncertainties and risks associated with international markets could adversely impact our international operations.  We have significant international operations in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the U.S., Middle East and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permits and operating licenses required for us to operate, obtain access to local transmission facilities on economically acceptable terms, or market services in international markets. In addition, operating in international markets generally involves additional risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, customs, duties and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, problems in collecting accounts receivable, political risks, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, restrictions associated with the repatriation of funds, technology export and import restrictions, and seasonal reductions in business activity. Our ability to operate and grow our international operations successfully could be adversely impacted by these risks.  We operate in a complex regulatory environment, and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.  Our operations are subject to a broad range of complex and evolving laws and regulations. Because of our coverage in many countries, we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions. Some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change from time to time. Violation of such laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties, damage our reputation, constitute a breach of our client agreements, impair our ability to obtain and renew required licenses, and decrease our profitability or competitiveness. If any of these effects were to occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, to serve our international markets, we maintain business entities in various jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, we must maintain and operate these business entities in compliance with the applicable corporate, tax, employment and other laws of these various jurisdictions, which adds complexity to our operations. Our failure to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations could give rise to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We may not be able to integrate new technologies and provide new services in a cost-efficient manner.  The telecommunications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology, frequent new service introductions and evolving industry standards. We cannot predict the effect of these changes on our competitive position, our profitability or the industry in general. Technological developments may reduce the competitiveness of our networks and our software solutions and require additional capital expenditures or the procurement of additional products that could be expensive and time consuming. In addition, new products and services arising out of technological developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological advances or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be limited in our ability to attract new customers and or sell new services to our existing customers. In addition, delivery of new services in a cost-efficient manner depends upon many factors, and we may not generate anticipated revenue from such services.  We may not be able to develop and successfully market our mobile telecommunications platform and services as planned.  Pareteum operates in an exceptionally competitive environment where there is continuous innovation and new development. We are required to be a top performer in over a dozen highly specialized domains to effectively compete with our competitors. Ongoing investments are required to stay ahead of the competition. The sales process for our platform and the deployment process may be complicated and very slow. We are highly dependent on convincing mobile network operators and mobile virtual network operators to believe that outsourcing their requirements to us is the best way to go. We are exposed to business risks associated with turnkey projects and the scalability of our service and support organization. Although our policy is to avoid or minimize risks, it cannot be ruled out that in certain cases events occur that may seriously impact us and our performance.  Implementation and development of our software platform business depends on our ability to obtain adequate funding.  Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. When our available cash and cash equivalents become insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or if and when we identify additional opportunities to do so, we will likely seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities.  Failure to obtain such adequate financing will substantially delay our development, slow down current operations, result in loss of customers and adversely impact our results of operations. Additionally, the funds we need may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to obtain additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.  Disruptions in our networks and infrastructure may result in customer dissatisfaction, customer loss or both, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and business.  Our systems are an integral part of our customers business operations. It is critical for our customers that our systems provide a continued and uninterrupted performance. Customers may be dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide services to them. Sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our services significantly and could result in decreased demand for our services.  We face the following risks to our networks, infrastructure and software applications    significant weather events can physically damage access lines;   power surges and outages, computer viruses or hacking, earthquakes, terrorism attacks, vandalism and software or hardware defects which are beyond our control; and   unusual spikes in demand or capacity limitations in our or our suppliers networks.  Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and or incur expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenue and cash flow.  Cybersecurity breaches and other disruptions could adversely affect our business, and could compromise our information and expose us to liability and reputational harm.  The size and complexity of our information systems make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent or quickly identify service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Similarly, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could be harmed if technologies integrated into our products fail to prevent cyberattacks, or if our customers fail to safeguard the systems with security policies that conform to industry best practices. In addition, any cyberattack or security breach that affects a competitors product could lead to the negative perception that our products are similarly vulnerable to attacks or breaches.  In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary and or personally identifiable information of customers, partners, employees, and other third parties. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and precautions, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any hack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, lead to reputational harm or loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business.  Integration of acquisitions ultimately may not provide the benefits originally anticipated by management and may distract the attention of our personnel from the operation of our business.  We strive to broaden our solutions offerings as well as to increase the number of subscribers hosted on our platforms, volume of voice and data that we carry over our existing global network in order to reduce transmission costs and other operating costs as a percentage of net revenue, improve margins, improve service quality and enhance our ability to introduce new products and services. Strategic acquisitions in desired markets play a part of our growth strategy, and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future to further strengthen our strategic objectives. Acquisitions of businesses and customer lists involve operational risks, including the possibility that an acquisition may not ultimately provide the benefits originally anticipated by management. Moreover, we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates, completing and financing additional acquisitions on favorable terms, or integrating the acquired business or assets into our own. There may be difficulty in integrating technologies and solutions, in migrating customer bases and in integrating the service offerings, distribution channels and networks gained through acquisitions with our own. For example, our recent acquisitions have led to the unexpected addition of a significant amount of aged accounts payable to our balance sheet. Successful integration of operations and technologies requires the dedication of management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business, the development or acquisition of new technologies, and the pursuit of other business acquisition opportunities. Therefore, successful integration may not occur in light of these factors.  Our revenue, earnings and profitability are affected by the length of our sales cycle, and a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our business is directly affected by the length of our sales cycle and strategic mobile partnership cycles with mobile network operators and other large enterprises. Our software platforms, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services, are relatively complex and their purchase may involve a significant commitment of mostly human capital, with attendant delays frequently associated with the allocation of substantial human resources and procurement procedures within an organization. The purchase of these types of products typically also requires coordination and agreement across many departments within a potential customer. Delays associated with such timing factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In periods of economic slowdown in the communications industry, which may recur in the current economic climate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government shutdown orders that have been implemented in many jurisdictions around the world in an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic, our typical sales cycle may lengthen, which means that the average time between our initial contact with a prospective customer and the signing of a sales contract increases. The lengthening of our sales and strategic mobile partnership cycle could reduce growth in our revenue in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Because most of our business is conducted outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar could adversely affect our results of operations.  Currently most of our net revenue, expenses and capital expenditures are derived and incurred from sales and operations outside the U.S., whereas the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. Dollar  USD . The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country, making the Euro the predominant currency in which our business is conducted. Considering the fact that most income and expenses are not subject to relevant exchange rate differences, it is only at a reporting level that the translation needs to be made to the reporting unit of USD. In the future, we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our net revenue and incur a significant portion of our operating costs outside the U.S., and changes in exchange rates have had and may continue to have a significant, and potentially distorting effect  either negative or positive  on the reported results of operations, not necessarily being the result of operations in real terms. Our primary risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused by fluctuations in the USD Euro exchange rates.  We historically have not engaged in hedging transactions since we primarily operate in same currency countries, currently being the Euro  EUR . However, the operations of affiliates and subsidiaries in non-US countries have been funded with investments and other advances denominated in foreign currencies and more recently in USD. Historically, such investments and advances have been long-term in nature, and we have accounted for any adjustments resulting from currency translation as a charge or credit to Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Stockholders Equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we have not engaged in hedging in the past, we continue to assess on a regular basis the possible need for hedging.  We are substantially smaller than our major competitors, whose marketing and pricing decisions, and relative size advantage, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and are likely to continue to cause significant pricing pressures that could adversely affect our net revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Our services related to cloud-based communications software and information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services are subject to competitive pressure, and we expect competition to continue to increase. We compete with telecom solution providers, independent software and service providers and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services  including consulting, systems integration and managed services , software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services  such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus  and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment. Also, in this more fragmented market, larger players exist with associated advantages described earlier with which we need to compete against.  We believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including    the development by others of software products that are competitive with our products and services;   the price at which others offer competitive software and services;   the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;   the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;   the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;   the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and   the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.  A number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Many of our competitors are also able to offer service at lower prices than we are, forcing us to match their prices in response. This negatively affects our gross margins and financial results of operations. If we fail to effectively compete, we may experience lower revenues and or net income, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our positioning in the marketplace as a smaller provider places a significant strain on our resources, and if not managed effectively, could result in operational inefficiencies and other difficulties.  Our positioning in the marketplace may place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources, and increase demand on our systems and controls. To manage this position effectively, we must continue to implement and improve our operational and financial systems and controls, invest in development and engineering, critical systems and network infrastructure to maintain or improve our service quality levels, purchase and utilize other systems and solutions, and train and manage our employee base. As we proceed with our development, operational difficulties could arise from additional demand placed on customer provisioning and support, billing and management information systems, product delivery and fulfillment, sales and marketing and administrative resources.  For instance, we may encounter delays or cost overruns or suffer other adverse consequences in implementing new systems when required. In addition, our operating and financial control systems and infrastructure could be inadequate to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  We need to grow our business and revenue in order to achieve profitability.  We need to expand our network to maintain and grow our business and revenue. If we fail to expand and maintain an effective sales force or successfully develop our relationships with new customers, our business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully grow our client base or expand the number of services provided to them. If we fail to do so, our sales could fail to grow or could decline, and our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected, which could prevent our revenues from covering our fixed costs and deny the Company operating leverage, delaying the date at which we achieve profitability. Accordingly, if we do not grow our revenue and business, we will not achieve profitability in the near term, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.  We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if U.S. or foreign taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws.  Our corporate structure is based, in part, on assumptions about the various tax laws, including withholding tax, and other relevant laws of applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions. Foreign taxing authorities may not agree with our interpretations or reach different conclusions. Our interpretations are not binding on any taxing authority and, if these foreign jurisdictions were to change or to modify the relevant laws, we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences or have the anticipated benefits of our corporate structure materially impaired. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, that, if not remediated, or if we identify additional material weaknesses or other adverse findings in the future, may not allow us to be able to report our financial condition or results of operations accurately or timely, which may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies, and ultimately have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report, our management identified material weaknesses in internal controls related to    Inadequate and ineffective management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, including insufficient experienced resources to complete the documentation of internal control assessment;   Ineffective design, implementation and monitoring of information technology general controls pertaining to the Companys change management process;   entity-level controls were not effective due to certain executive management tone at the top issues which contributed to an ineffective control environment and to deficiencies aggregating to material weaknesses; and   the Company not having sufficient accounting and finance department resources to effectively assess risk and design, operate and oversee effective internal controls over financial reporting, which contributed to the failure in the effectiveness and adequate identification of certain controls including   o application of appropriate revenue recognition standards;  o proper accounting of share-based compensation;  o appropriate settlement of payables via issuance of shares;  o complete and appropriate application of foreign currency translations;  o identification and accounting of operating leases in accordance with ASC 842; and  o method of accounting for acquisitions and business combinations.  As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019. As described in Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, of this Annual Report, we are implementing remedial measures that we believe will effectively remedy the material weakness. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness timely and sufficiently, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we could suffer future material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and class action litigation.  We must attract and retain skilled personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain technical, technical sales and operational employees, our business could be harmed.  Our ability to manage our growth will be particularly dependent on our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force and qualified technical and managerial personnel. We need software development specialists with in-depth knowledge of a blend of IT and telecommunications or with a blend of security and telecommunications. We intend to hire additional necessary employees, including software engineers, communication engineers, project managers, sales consultants, employees and operational employees, on a permanent basis. The competition for qualified technical sales, technical, and managerial personnel in the communications and software industry is intense in the markets where we operate, and we may not be able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel. In addition, we may not be able to maintain the quality of our operations, control our costs, maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, and expand our internal management, technical, information and accounting systems in order to support our desired growth, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. Volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish our use, and the value, of our equity awards as incentives to employees, putting us at a competitive disadvantage or forcing us to use more cash compensation. Accordingly, our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  If we are not able to use and protect our intellectual property domestically and internationally, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our ability to compete depends, in part, on our ability to use intellectual property internationally. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trade secrets and confidentiality, trademarks and licenses to protect our intellectual property. There is limited protection under patent law to protect the source codes we developed or acquired on our platform. The copyright and know-how protection on which we rely may not be sufficient. Our granted patents and pending patent applications may be challenged. We are also subject to the risks of claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. The telecommunications industry is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We rely upon certain technology, including hardware and software, licensed from third parties. The technology licensed by us may not continue to provide competitive features and functionality. Licenses for technology currently used by us or other technology that we may seek to license in the future may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are dependent on one significant customer for a substantial portion of our business and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had one significant customer that accounted for 20  and 64  of our revenue, respectively. Although no other customer accounted for greater than 10  of our net sales during this period, other customers may account for more than 10  of our net sales in future periods. Additionally, because many of our other customers produce net losses for us, the loss, or reduction in services to this significant customer or other discontinuation of their relationship with us for any reason, or if this significant customer reduces or postpones purchases that we expect to receive, it could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our success depends on our continued investment in research and development, the level and effectiveness of which could reduce our profitability.  We intend to continue to make investments in research and development and product development in seeking to sustain and improve our competitive position and meet our customers needs. These investments currently include streamlining our suite of software functionalities, including modularization and improving scalability of our integrated solutions. To maintain our competitive position, we may need to increase our research and development investment, which could reduce our profitability and cash flows, thereby causing a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will achieve a return on these investments, nor can we assure you that these investments will improve our competitive position or meet our customers needs.  Product defects or software errors could adversely affect our business.  Design defects or software errors may cause delays in product introductions and project implementations, damage customer satisfaction and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our software systems are highly complex and may, from time to time, contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and correct. Because our products are generally used by our customers to perform critical business functions, design defects, software errors, misuse of our products, incorrect data from external sources or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise during implementation or from the use of our products and may result in financial or other damages to our customers, for which we may be held responsible. Although we have license agreements with our customers that contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from customer problems, these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions. Our insurance coverage is not sufficient to protect against all possible liability for defects or software errors. In addition, as a result of business and other considerations, we may undertake to compensate our customers for damages caused to them arising from the use of our products, even if our liability is limited by a license or other agreement. Claims and liabilities arising from customer problems could also damage our reputation, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Political risks, including changes to U.S. tariff and import export regulations may have a negative effect on our business.  There have been recent changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including determinations made by the U.S. to reinstate or impose new sanctions levied by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control against certain nation states. The Company or its subsidiaries may engage in business with entities located in certain regions which may be impacted, directly or indirectly by such changes. If the Company is precluded as a result of changes to sanctions laws from doing business in certain jurisdictions or with certain entities, the loss of any related revenues could impact our business, results of operations and or financial condition.  We, and certain of our directors and current and former officers, have been named as parties to various lawsuits and those lawsuits could adversely affect us, require significant management time and attention, result in significant legal expenses or damages, and cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to suffer.  A number of lawsuits have been filed against us, including securities class action complaints. If these matters cannot be resolved expeditiously, managements attention may be diverted to this matter and there can be no assurance that the litigation would be settled. If the current litigation proceeds or if additional claims are filed, the legal and other costs associated with the defense of these actions and their ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we expect insurance to cover many of the costs associated with defending such litigation, insurance coverage may be insufficient and could require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.  Although we have directors and officers liability insurance, such insurance may be insufficient to cover the liabilities incurred under all claims and any claims against us may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.  Although we have directors and officers liability insurance, the coverage under such policies may be insufficient to cover any claim, including the claims pending against us and certain of our directors and officers resulting from the restatement of our financial statements  see Item 3. Legal Proceedings . Because we also have obligations to indemnify our current and former officers and directors under our governing documents, liabilities in excess of the limits of our insurance policies that may be imposed in connection with actions against certain of the Companys past and present directors and officers and certain current and former employees who are entitled to indemnification will be funded by the Company with its existing cash resources. Such expenses could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Risks Related to Our Industry  Changes in the regulation of the telecommunications industry could adversely affect our business, revenue or cash flow.  We operate in a heavily regulated industry. As a provider of communications technology, we are directly and indirectly subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials. Certain European, foreign, U.S. federal, and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which we offer and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact they will have on our business, revenue and cash flow.  There can be no assurance that future regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us, or that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon us. Potential future regulatory, judicial, legislative, and government policy changes in jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on us. Domestic or international regulators or third parties may raise material issues regarding our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations, and therefore may have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, growth and financial performance.  The telecommunications industry is rapidly changing, and if we are not able to adjust our strategy and resources effectively in the future to meet changing market conditions, we may not be able to compete effectively.  The telecommunications industry is changing rapidly due to deregulation, privatization, consolidation, technological improvements, availability of alternative services such as mobile, broadband, DSL, Internet, VOIP, and wireless DSL through use of the fixed wireless spectrum, and the globalization of the worlds economies. In addition, alternative services to traditional land-line services, such as mobile, broadband, Internet and VOIP services, have shown a competitive threat to our legacy land-line traffic business. If we do not continue to invest and exploit the contemplated plan of development of our communications information systems, outsourced solutions and value-added communication services to meet changing market conditions, or if we do not have adequate resources, we may not be able to compete effectively in providing technology solutions to our customers. The telecommunications industry is marked by the introduction of new product and service offerings and technological improvements. Achieving successful financial results will depend on our ability to anticipate, assess and adapt to rapid technological changes, and offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, services including the bundling of multiple services into our technology platforms that meet evolving industry standards. If we do not anticipate, assess or adapt to such technological changes at a competitive price, maintain competitive services or obtain new technologies on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected.  If we are not able to operate a cost-effective network, we may not be able to grow our business successfully.  Our long-term success depends on our ability to design, implement, operate, manage and maintain a reliable and cost-effective network. In addition, we rely on third parties to enable us to expand and manage our global network and to provide local, broadband Internet and mobile services. If we are unable to grow and operate a cost-effective network for our customers, our business may fail to grow or decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Risks Related to Our Capital Stock  Covenant restrictions in our debt instruments may limit our flexibility to operate and grow our business, and if we are not able to comply with such covenants, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness, proceed against certain collateral or exercise other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on us.  On June 8, 2020, we closed the issuance of  17.5 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2025  the 2020 Note  under the terms of a securities purchase agreement, also dated as of June 8, 2020  together with the 2020 Note, the Note Facility . The covenants in the Note Facility documents contain a number of provisions that impose operating and financial restrictions which, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things  incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions or redeem or repurchase our securities, make certain investments, grant liens on assets, sell or dispose of any material assets; and acquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies. Additionally, the Note Facility documents contain affirmative covenants that require to us take, and have taken by certain dates, specific actions, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including  i  us filing our restated Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC on or prior to October 31, 2020,  ii  after October 31, 2020, our timely filing subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC and  iii  us maintaining the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement with the holder of the 2020 Note under which we admitted that we were in default of several obligations and such holder acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the Note Facility documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the 2020 Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020  since extended to March 31, 2021 , the date of any new event of default or the initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in such forbearance agreement.  Complying with these covenants, as well as those that may be contained in any future debt agreements, may limit our ability to finance our future operations or working capital needs or to take advantage of future business opportunities. Our ability to comply with these covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control. If we do not maintain and regain compliance with our continuing obligations or any covenants, terms and conditions of the Note Facility, after the expiration of the forbearance agreement, we could be in default and required to repay outstanding borrowings on an accelerated basis, which could subject us to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the case of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments under the Note Facility. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under the terms of our Note Facility, the lenders thereunder may choose to exercise their remedies in respect to the collateral, including a foreclosure of their lien which may result in a sale of certain of our assets to satisfy our obligations under the Note Facility.  We could issue additional common stock, which might dilute the book value of our capital stock.  Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or a part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Any such stock issuance could be made at a price that reflects a discount or a premium to the then-current trading price of our common stock. In addition, in order to raise future capital, we may need to issue securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for a significant amount of our common stock. These issuances, if any, would dilute your percentage ownership interest in the Company, thereby having the effect of reducing your influence on matters on which stockholders vote. You may incur additional dilution if holders of stock options, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, exercise their options, or if warrant holders exercise their warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. As a result, any such issuances or exercises would dilute your interest in the Company and the per share book value of the common stock that you owned, either of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of your investment.  Shares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market for our common stock.  As of December 31, 2020, there are  i  6,704,803 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, 37,298,850 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 29,166,667 shares of common stock that may be issued upon the conversion of outstanding convertible indebtedness. Options are exercisable at exercise prices between  0.36 and  62.50 and the warrants are exercisable at exercise prices between  0.37 and  5.38. Accrued interest owed on the 2020 Note may also be paid in the form of shares of our common stock from time to time. If and when these securities are exercised or converted into shares of our common stock, the number of our shares of common stock outstanding will increase. Such increase in our outstanding shares, and any subsequent sales of such shares, could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock.  In addition, from time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended  the Securities Act , subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, after satisfying a six month holding period   i  affiliated stockholders  or stockholders whose shares are aggregated  may, under certain circumstances, sell within any three-month period a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of 1  of the then outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume of the class during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale and  ii  non-affiliated stockholders may sell without such limitations, provided that we are current in our public reporting obligations. Rule 144 also permits the sale of securities by non-affiliates that have satisfied a one year holding period without any limitation or restriction. Any substantial sale of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.  Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.s Pink Open Market which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.  On November 10, 2020, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC  Nasdaq  notified the Company that, because of the Companys failure to satisfy the conditions to the exception to Nasdaqs listing standards granted by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, our common stock would be delisted, and trading of our common stock on Nasdaqs Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. After trading of the Companys common stock was suspended by Nasdaq, prices for our common stock began being quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.s Pink Open Market  the Pink Sheets . The delisting became effective on February 12, 2021. The Pink Sheets is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. The quotation of our shares on the Pink Sheets may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.  Because our common stock is no longer listed on a registered national securities exchange, we are subject to certain blue sky laws of the various states that impose restrictions on our ability to offer and sell our securities. These blue sky laws may make it more difficult for us to raise capital or to issue our common stock for equity compensation or other strategic purposes, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations or to attract and retain employees.  In addition, our common stock may be classified as a penny stock under Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. Penny stocks are subject to Rule 15g-9, which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market. To the extent our common stock is subject to the penny stock regulations, the market liquidity for the shares will be adversely affected and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future on favorable terms, or at all.  We have no dividend history and have no intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.  We have never paid dividends on or in connection with our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends to common stockholders for the foreseeable future."}

Pareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation  USA, 1962  and Elephant Talk Limited  Hong Kong, 1994 . Since 2016, our name has been Pareteum Corporation, and from November 12, 2019 until November 12, 2020, our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol TEUM. Prices for our common stock are now quoted on the Pink Sheets under the same symbol.  Restatement and Revision of Previously Issued Interim Financial Statements  We restated the unaudited quarterly financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The impact of the restatement is reflected in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  MD A , see the discussion below in Consolidated Quarterly Results. The Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019 with the SEC.  Delisting of the Companys Common Stock  On November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Companys common stock to remain listed on Nasdaq Capital Market.  In response to the Companys notice to the Nasdaq Stock Market that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearing Panel, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Companys common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Companys common stock on Nasdaqs Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. Since the trading of the Companys common stock was suspended, prices for our common stock have been quoted on Pink Sheets.  Results of Operations  Consolidated Annual Results  Our results of operations for the periods presented were as follows   Years Ended December 31, Change     in thousands  Increase  Decrease   REVENUES   62,049   20,258   41,791  COST AND OPERATING EXPENSES  Cost of revenues  excluding depreciation and amortization  47,134 10,054 37,080  Product development 12,956 3,083 9,873  Sales and marketing 10,345 3,197 7,148  General and administrative 34,583 17,330 17,253  Restructuring and acquisition costs 3,457 7,260  3,803    Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 160,989 - 160,989  Depreciation and amortization 12,938 5,427 7,511  Total cost and operating expenses 282,402 46,351 236,051  LOSS FROM OPERATIONS  220,353    26,093    194,260    OTHER INCOME  EXPENSE   Interest income  Interest expense  2,120    309    1,811    Interest expense related to debt discount and conversion feature  619    184    435    Changes in derivative liabilities - 1,284  1,284    Loss on extinguishment of debt  8,873   -  8,873    Gain on equity investment - 6,371  6,371    Amortization of deferred financing costs  237    29    208    Other income  expense , net  3,221    3,799    Total other income  expense   14,712   7,895  22,607    LOSS BEFORE BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES  235,065    18,198    216,867    Income tax benefit  8,295    174    8,121    NET LOSS  226,770    18,024    208,746    OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS  Foreign currency translation loss  219    200    19    COMPREHENSIVE LOSS    226,989      18,224      208,765    Although the majority of our business activity is carried out in Euros, we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars  USD . The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. These fluctuations in the USD Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects  not to be confused with real currency exchange effects , which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.  The following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018   USD  Equivalent  Euro   1.14460   1.18102  British Pound   1.27369   1.33501  Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018  Revenue  We generate revenues primarily through providing CPaaS solutions to enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT, and telecommunications infrastructure providers. Our solutions are hosted software solutions that generate hosting and subscription revenue. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. We offer managed services and bundled services for our mobile solutions services. Managed service revenues are recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users managed and is calculated based on a pre-determined service fee per user. For bundled services, we provide both network administration as well as mobile airtime management services. Bundled service revenue is recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users of managed and mobile airtime usage, calculated based on a pre-determined service fee. We also earn revenue from telecommunications services we offer, which revenue is based on a pre-determined rate and number of user minutes and calls that we manage in a given month. We also earn revenue from professional services, including consulting services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration and training.  Our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were  62.0 million, an increase of  41.8 million, or 206 , compared to  20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the Companys inclusion of a full year of revenues of Artilium following the acquisition of Artilium in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the addition of iPass revenues following the iPass acquisition in the first quarter of 2019.  Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.  Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was  47.1 million, an increase of  37.1 million, or 369 , compared to  10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Similar to the increase in revenues, the increase in cost of revenues in 2019 was primarily due to Companys acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.  Product Development  Product development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Companys services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum BOSS   IN platform development and testing are included in this function.  Costs incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Companys operations, are capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized  6.4 million and  1.3 million, respectively, of internal-use software.  Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were  13.0 million and  3.1 million, respectively, an increase of  9.9 million, or 320 , primarily due to the incremental product developments costs of the iPass business acquired in 2019.  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.  Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were  10.3 million and  3.2 million, respectively, an increase of  7.1 million, or 224 . The increase was due to additions to the sales force as well as the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses in 2019.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses are our largest cost, other than our impairment charge, and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.  General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were  34.6 million and  17.3 million, respectively, an increase of  17.3 million, or 100 . An increase in non-cash compensation, staff-related costs and the addition of Artilium and iPass resulted in higher general administrative expenses of  5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. In 2019, the Company worked to decrease the compensatory costs from Artilium through identified synergies as a result of the acquisition.  Restructuring and Acquisition Costs  Restructuring and acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were  3.5 million and  7.3 million, respectively, a decrease of  3.8 million or 52 . The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were  3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass compared to  7.1 million related to our acquisition of Artilium in 2018.  Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on results of the goodwill impairment test, the Company determined that the estimated fair values of two of the Companys three operating segments, Artilium and iPass, were less than their carrying values. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of  129.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of its goodwill from  139.2 million to  10.1 million. In determining the estimated fair value of its reporting unit, the Company used the income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value is based on the present value of discounted cash flows projected which includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. The primary factor contributing to the reduction in the fair value of the Companys reporting unit was a significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections following the below expectations performance of Artilium and iPass during 2019, which the Company primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment.  Based on the Companys review for impairment of intangible assets, the Company determined that the carrying values exceeded the fair values by  31.9 million. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of  31.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets to  15.5 million. The primary factor contributing to the impairment charge was the significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections which the Company primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment.  Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was  12.9 million and  5.4 million, an increase of  7.5 million, or 138 . The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired through the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.  Interest Income  Interest income increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.  Interest Expense  Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was  2.1 million and  0.3 million, respectively, an increase of  1.8 million. The increase results primarily from borrowings under that certain credit agreement  the Credit Agreement  with Post Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP  the Post Road Loan  entered into February 2019, which was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019.  see Note 15, Stockholders Equity - Securities Purchase Agreement .  Interest Expense Related to Debt Discount and Conversion Feature  For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expenses related to debt discount and conversion features of certain of our exercisable and convertible securities was  0.6 million and  0.2 million, respectively, an increase of  0.4 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan Facility in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019.  see Note 15, Stockholders Equity - Securities Purchase Agreement .  Changes in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities  In 2018, we recognized a revaluation gain of  1.3 million on derivative liabilities associated with a promissory note that was settled in the third quarter of 2018. We did not have a similar transaction in 2019.  Loss on Extinguishment of Debt  In 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of  8.9 million related to the extinguishment of Post Road Loan and Fortress Credit Agreement in September 2019  see Note 12, Long-term Debt .  Gain on Equity Investment  In 2018, we recognized a gain on equity investment that represents the gain in our equity investment in Artilium at its carrying value of  3.2 million at the time of our acquisition of Artilium compared to its acquisition-date fair value of  9.6 million. There is no comparable transaction in 2019.  Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs  Amortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 was  0.2 million, compared to a de minimis amount in the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in September 2019.  Other Income  expense , net  Other income  expense  net, is generated from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded other expense, net of  3.2 million compared to other income, net of  0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of  3.8 million was primarily due to the recognition of a reserve on a note receivable and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on our results in 2018 when compared to 2019.  Income Taxes Benefit  Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was  8.3 million and  0.2 million, respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability resulting from the Artilium acquisition. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Artilium and as a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of  8.6 million for the basis difference on acquired intangible assets and tax attributes from the business combination. The total tax-effected intangible impairment for Artilium in 2019 totaled  17.2 million.  Other Comprehensive Loss  We record foreign currency translation gains and losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive income  loss . Foreign currency translation loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was  0.2 million and  0.2 million, respectively.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Quarterly Results of Operations Discussion   Revenues  Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.  Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was  13.1 million, a  9.4 million or 258  increase compared to  3.7 million for the comparable three months in 2018. Our deployments with existing customers continue to grow, new implementations generated new revenues and new cloud-based revenues were all factors in our revenue growth. Additionally, revenues include  8.9 million in revenues from Artilium and iPass which were acquired in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively. Comparable revenues were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.  Comparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were  16.9 million and  29.9 million; a  13.0 million and  22.4 million, respectively, or 335  and 298 , respectively, increase compared to  3.9 million and  7.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three and six months in 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018.  Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of service excludes depreciation and amortization.  Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.  Cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was  8.0 million, an increase of  6.8 million or 571 , compared to  1.2 million for the comparable three-month period in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, this includes  5.0 million of cost of revenues for Artilium and iPass. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.  Comparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  Cost of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was  12.6 million and  20.7 million, respectively, an increase of  10.8 million and  17.7 million, respectively, or 589  and 581 , respectively, compared to  1.8 million and  3.0 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and volume in revenue growth.  Product Development  Product development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Companys services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum BOSS   IN platform development and testing are included in this function.  Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.  Product development costs for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were  2.6 million and  0.7 million, respectively, an increase of  1.8 million or 251 . The increase is primarily due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year and the inclusion of product development costs of  0.8 million for Artilium and iPass for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.  Comparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  Product development costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were  3.6 million and  6.2 million, respectively, an increase of  2.8 million and  4.6 million, respectively, or 351  and 303 , respectively, compared to  0.8 million and  1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase was due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year. The increase in product development costs is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and overall expansion of our lines of business year over year.  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.  Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.  Sales and marketing expenses for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were  2.9 million and  0.7 million, respectively, an increase of  2.2 million or 317 . This increase is primarily a direct result of hiring new employees, the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses of  0.9 million, and other incremental costs incurred as the Company expanded.  Comparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  Sales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were  3.1 million and  6.0 million, respectively, an increase of  2.3 million and  4.5 million, respectively, or 283  and 299 , respectively, compared to  0.8 million and  1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and hiring new employees and allocating resources to growing our business.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses are typically our largest cost and consist primarily of overhead related salaries and expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.  Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.  General and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were  7.9 million and  1.8 million, respectively, an increase of  6.1 million or 334 . These increases were primarily due to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses for Artilium and iPass of  3.6 million and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense.  Comparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  General and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were  8.4 million and  16.3 million, respectively, an increase of  6.1 million and  12.2 million, respectively, or 271  and 299 , respectively, compared to  2.3 million and  4.1 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense.  Restructuring and Acquisition Charges  Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.  Restructuring and acquisition charges for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were  3.3 million and  0.1 million, an increase of  3.2 million. The costs incurred in 2019 were primarily the result of the iPass acquisition which was completed on February 12, 2019.  Comparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.  Restructuring and acquisition charges for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were  0.1 million. Restructuring and acquisition costs of  3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were comprised predominantly of acquisition costs related to the acquisition of iPass that was completed on February 12, 2019 and to a lesser extent, restructuring charges following the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.  Restructuring and acquisition charges for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 were not significant.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company reported net losses of  226.8 million and  18.0 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of  543.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and  317.1 million as of December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of  129.1 million and intangible assets impairment of  31.9 million.  The cash balance, including restricted cash and cash, of the Company at December 31, 2019 was  5.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, our cash balance, including restricted cash, was  6.5 million.  On June 8, 2020, we issued a  17.5 million 8  Senior Secured Convertible Note  the High Trail Note  to High Trail Investments SA LLC  High Trail  due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of  14 million, of which  7 million is currently maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note and related documents require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including  i  the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for  a  the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018,  b  the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and  c  the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020,  ii  after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act and  iii  the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement  the Forbearance Agreement  with High Trail under which   i  we admitted that we were in default of several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements,  ii  High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020  since extended to March 31, 2021 , the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the Forbearance Agreement. As a result of the defaults, the interest rate paid on the principal outstanding under the High Trail Note increased to 18  per annum. As partial consideration for its agreement to not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail financing documents, we agreed with High Trail to make certain changes to the High Trail Note and related agreements. In this regard, we agreed to delete the Floor Price of  0.10 that had previously limited the number of shares of Company common stock into which  i  the outstanding indebtedness could be converted upon default and  ii  payments of interest could be made. We also agreed to increase the number of shares it was required to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the High Trail Note and to decrease the exercise price of the related warrant from  0.58 to  0.37.  On February 22, 2021, the Company closed the issuance of  2.4 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025  the Second Lien Notes . The Second Lien Notes were sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2021, entered into by and between the Company and an institutional investor. The aggregate purchase price for the Second Lien Notes and related warrant to purchase common stock was  2.0 million. The Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 at a rate of 8  per annum. The Second Lien Notes are secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding, such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares issuable to pay interest in shares is determined by the application of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85  of the lowest volume-weighted average price of the Companys common stock on the principal market for the Companys common stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment.  Subject to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Note. The holder of the Second Lien Note or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Second Lien Notes at a 20  premium if the Company undergoes a fundamental change. The Second Lien Notes will be convertible into shares of common stock, in part or in whole, from time to time, at the election of the holder of the Second Lien Notes. The initial conversion rate is 1666.6667 shares of Company common stock for each  1,000 of principal amount of Second Lien Notes. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Companys common stock.  Because of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, and the limited amount of additional capital we raised by selling the Second Lien Notes, we believe that we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.  As a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, has negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stocks delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.  Operating Activities  We reported net cash used in operating activities of  17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash used in operating activities of  7.8 million in 2018, an increase in cash used of  9.9 million. Operating activities decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in net operating results after the add back of the  161.0 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and  8.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs, share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and change in fair value of warrant liability.     in thousands   Net loss    226,770      18,024    Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities  192,617 5,511   34,153    12,513    Changes in operating assets and liabilities  16,392 4,693  Net cash used in operating activities    17,761      7,820    Investing Activities  Net cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2019, was  11.1 million, a decrease of  0.4 million or 3 , compared to  11.5 million net cash used in investing activities in 2018. This decrease is a result of an all common stock acquisition of iPass in the year ended December 31, 2019 partially offset by an increase in capitalized software, notes receivable issued to a third party, and assets purchased from Devicescape Holdings, Inc.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was  28.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Financing activities increased as a result of the Companys issuance of common equity and redeemable preferred stock offset by repayment of loans issued during the current year and the repayment of debt held by iPass as of the date of the acquisition.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services  unconditional purchase obligations . We entered into the Strategic Connectivity Agreement  the Connectivity Agreement  with Hutchison 3G UK Limited  3UK  on July 23, 2019. Under the Connectivity Agreement, we are obligated to pay 3UK  0.6 million for the implementation of a MVNO  the 3UK MVNO , and for monthly services provided, based on usage, after the 3UK MVNO is launched, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2019,  0.1 million was invoiced by 3UK and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. Of the remaining unconditional purchase obligation to 3UK outstanding as of December 31, 2019, we expect to incur  0.1 million in 2020 and the remainder in 2021.  Concurrent with the execution of the Connectivity Agreement, we entered into the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Credit Voucher  the Credit Voucher Agreement  with PCCW Global Limited  PCCW  under which we are obligated to purchase a credit voucher for  28.0 million. The credit voucher will be used to offset certain monthly service charges incurred under the Connectivity Agreement. As of December 31, 2019,  0.6 million of the purchase price has been recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining  27.5 million unconditional purchase obligation is due and payable following the launch date of the 3UK MVNO, with minimum aggregate payments due as of June 30th, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025.  See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details about these off-balance sheet arrangements.  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Revenue Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenues  Revenue represents amounts earned for  non-software  arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  Monthly Service Revenues   The Companys performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service  SaaS  and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore, are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with true-up adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically significant.  Installation and Software Development Revenues   The Companys other revenues consist generally of installation and software development projects.  Installation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Companys monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.  Software development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customers existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.  Revenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.  Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations   The Companys contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.  Contract assets and liabilities   Given the nature of the Companys services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess of revenues when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.  Payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.  Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, materials and supplies, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based expenses and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  We record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful.  Income Taxes  We estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.  We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.  Share-based Compensation  The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation  ASC 718 . Under ASC 718, share-based awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense with an adjustment for forfeiture over the employees requisite service period  the vesting period, generally three years , which the Company amortizes on a straight-line basis.  For both contractors and advisory board members, we recognize the guidance for share-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees  ASC 505-50 . Under ASC 505-50, we determine the fair value of the options or share-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.  Share-based compensation  cash and non-cash  related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors are included within our cost of revenues and operating expenses.  Warrant and Conversion feature derivative liabilities  Warrants and convertible notes that are accounted for as derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement  ASC 820 . The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party valuation expert to fair value the derivative liabilities.  Business Combinations  We generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the purchase method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.  Significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment, or one level below the operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment.  We test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a step two test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the period the impairment is recognized.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition.  In accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  ASC 350 , intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use, is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset.  Contingent Losses  From time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent matters. Litigation and regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements."}
{"prompt":"","completion":" Item 1. Business  Overview   Pareteum Corporation  OTC  TEUM  is a cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every Thing .  Millions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteums global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteums goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things  IoT , and telecommunications infrastructure providers.  With estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteums cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.  The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market-driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners  whose technologies are integrated into our cloud  include  Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.  Pareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower Every Person and Every Thing  to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggregators  MVNO, MVNE and MVNA , Smart Cities, and application developer markets, each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications Platform-as-a-Service  CPaaS , which Pareteum delivers.  Coronavirus Pandemic  In March 2020, COVID-19 began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States  U.S.  declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results  the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect our operating and financial results to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.  We have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.  Innovative Use Cases  Many sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Companys platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others   Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.  Connected cars  Smart cities  Smart logistics and supply chains  Smart healthcare applications  In addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios  the Acquired IP Rights , which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.  Business Model  At Pareteum, our mission is to Empower Communications Service Providers  CSPs , Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity. We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.  However, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a network effect. The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.  To achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering mobility, engagement, intelligence and control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.  Go-to-Market and Growth Strategy  Pareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the 2018 and 2019 Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.  Pareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.  Our go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach   Phase 1  Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.  Phase 2  Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions  North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific .  Phase 3  Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more things  whether Subscriber Identification Module  SIM  cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.  to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market  including in developing markets .  Phase 4  At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.  The phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the worlds shift to an open mobility and application network. When were successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.  We also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas   Exploring cross-sale and up-sale opportunities among Pareteums recent customer acquisitions - focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;  Platform evolution - enhance and expand existing products and services; and  Geographic expansion-focusing on entering new markets, such as South East Asia and Latin America.  Employees  As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 200 total employees worldwide, of which 199 were full-time employees.  Research   Development  Pareteums research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were  10.3 million and  13.0 million, respectively.  Intellectual Property  Pareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking, and system and method for network curation, all expiring through 2034, and subject to renewals.  Pareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.  Sales and Marketing  Pareteums sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.  We engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product, and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.  Customers  Our customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.  A customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of hand-off from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom   U.K.  , Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.  Pareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24 7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteums customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.  The Company has significant customers and the loss of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two significant customers each individually accounted for 21  and 20  of our revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer accounted for 20  of our revenue.  Competition  We compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services  including consulting, systems integration and managed services , software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services  such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus  and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.  We believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including   the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;  the price at which others offer competitive software and services;  the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;  the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;  the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;  the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and  the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.  A number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.  The CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be   Scale and international reach of connectivity;  Comprehensiveness of platform offerings;  Ease of deployment and implementation; and  Scalability and reliability of service.  Pareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes   MVNE services for CSPs  In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.  Wi-Fi connectivity aggregation for enterprise customers  Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.  Short Message Service Application-To-Person  SMS A2P  messaging for Enterprise customers  Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable business-to-consumer messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface  API  integration.  IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers  Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.  Nevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.  One key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example   Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.  Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure  e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.  Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.  One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine  M2M  services  through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile  GSM  communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.  Regulatory  Pareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.  Privacy and Data Protection  The regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.  Because the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.  Any failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments or policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions  especially the European Union   EU   , enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.  Internationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we and our customers must comply, including but not limited to the EU, the U.K. and Switzerland. The EU and U.K. data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , which went into effect in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, U.K. and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of the EU, U.K. and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR  and its U.K. equivalent commonly referred to as the U.K. GDPR  regulates transfers of personal data  subject to such laws  from the European Economic Area  EEA  and the U.K. to the U.S. as well as other countries outside the EEA and the U.K. which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, U.K. and Switzerland to the U.S., creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the U.K. including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to U.S.-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects  for example, the right to be forgotten , increased data portability for EU and U.K. consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4  of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPRs and U.K. GDPRs requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and U.K. data protection regulators under GDPR and U.K. GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.  On January 31, 2020, the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as Brexit. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EUs trade agreements. Effective from January 1, 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the U.K. and the EU, as it existed before December 31, 2020, ended and the EU and the U.K. now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges  including data  that did not exist prior to December 31, 2020.  Even though the U.K. reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement   TCA   and related documents, and the U.K. government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws  including the implementation of U.K. GDPR  that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from January 1, 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the U.K.s relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the U.K.s new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the U.K. and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the U.K., the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.  Additionally, now that the U.K. and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the U.K. and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and or operational implications for our business that involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.  Although the current arrangements between the EU and U.K. permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from January 1, 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether U.K. is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the U.K. not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws  and related guidance  between the U.K. and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the U.K. and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.  Non-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards for non-U.S. nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.  U.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.  Telecommunications Regulations  Currently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.

The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. These fluctuations in the USD Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects  not to be confused with real currency exchange effects , which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.  The following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019   USD  Equivalent  Euro   1.13958   1.14460  British Pound   1.28235   1.27369  Revenue  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  69.6 million, an increase of  7.6 million, or 12.2 , compared to  62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for services in our mobility business, partially offset by a decrease in connectivity services, which includes travel-related communications. We attribute the net increase in demand to the overall impact that the COVID-related restrictions have had on demand for our various services, especially for messaging and consumer mobile services.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was  49.0 million, an increase of  1.8 million, or 3.9 , compared to  47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable service mix.  Product Development  During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized  6.5 million and  6.4 million, respectively, of internal-use software.  Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were  10.3 million and  13.0 million, respectively, a decrease of  2.6 million, or 20.2 . This decrease was mainly due to a decline in personnel and related costs in 2020 in part due to restraints on the Company's access to capital.  Sales and Marketing  Sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were  6.1 million and  10.3 million, respectively, a decrease of  4.2 million, or 40.6 . Sales and marketing expenses declined mainly due to a decrease in personnel and related costs and a reduction in sales costs due to COVID-related restrictions.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were  29.8 million and  34.6 million, respectively, a decrease of  4.8 million, or 13.8 . This decrease is primarily due to an absence in 2020 of iPass acquisition-related costs and reduction in 2020 of personnel costs, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the restatement of the Company's historical financial statements.  Acquisition Costs  There were no acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were  3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass.  Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  There was no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of  156.8 million, consisting of a  125.9 million impairment of goodwill and a  30.8 million impairment of intangible assets  see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets   Depreciation and Amortization  Depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was  10.8 million and  12.7 million, a decrease of  1.9 million, or 15.3 . The decrease is primarily due to the impairment of finite-lived intangible assets in 2019.  Interest Expense, net  Interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was  9.1 million and  2.6 million, respectively, an increase of  6.5 million due to increases in borrowings and the Company's effective borrowing rate, including borrowings under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Note.  Gain on sale of assets  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a  10.8 million gain on the sale of certain assets, the transfer of which was completed in December 2020  see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition .  Change in fair value of derivative and warrant liabilities  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized, in aggregate, a favorable  7.0 million change in fair value based on the fair value changes of embedded derivatives and warrant liability related to the Company's Senior Secured Convertible Note issued in June 2020 and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock  see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note - Derivative liability   Warrant liability and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Derivative liability   Warrant liability .  Loss on Extinguishment of Debt  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of  17.0 million related to the modification of certain provisions of the Series C redeemable preferred stock that was accounted for as an extinguishment  see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Series C redeemable preferred stock . For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of  8.9 million related to the extinguishment of debt previously outstanding under that certain Fortress Credit Agreement, under which we had borrowed funds from Fortress Credit Corp., and under that certain credit agreement with Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP in February 2019 and September 2019  see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - iPass, Inc. Acquisition and Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Former Post Road Group Debt Facility .  Other Income  Expense , net  Other income  expense  net, is generated from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded other income, net of  0.1 million compared to other expense, net of  3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The favorable change of  3.3 million was primarily due to a reserve recorded in 2019 on a note receivable and the favorable impact in 2020 for the forgiveness of a Paycheck Protection Program   PPP   loan in the amount of  0.6 million on our results in 2020 as compared to 2019.  Income Tax Benefit  Income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was  0.1 million and  8.3 million, respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability from the Artilium acquisition, which was a discrete item in 2019.  Accretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock  Accretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock for the years ended December 31, 2020 was  0.8 million. There were no amounts recorded to accretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock in 2019 since the modification and classification to temporary equity of the series C redeemable preferred stock occurred during 2020.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficits of  584.6 million and  539.5 million and reported net losses of  44.7 million and  222.3 million as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of  156.8 million, consisting of a  125.9 million impairment of goodwill and a  30.8 million intangible assets impairment.  The Company's cash balance, including restricted cash, was  14.8 million and  5.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  On June 8, 2020, we issued the High Trail Note with a principal amount of  17.5 million to High Trail Investments SA LLC  High Trail  due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of  14.0 million, of which  6.0 million was previously maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including  i  the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for  a  the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018,  b  the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and  c  the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020,  ii  after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act, and  iii  the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, we have been in default under the terms of the High Trail Note since October 31, 2020 and at High Trails option, High Trail can demand payment for the outstanding principal amount. In addition, the interest rate increased to 18  per annum. On April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing  6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.  On November 30, 2020, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement  the Forbearance Agreement  with High Trail. Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, High Trail agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and remedies. High Trail agreed that it would not, directly or indirectly, exercise any right or remedy under any transaction document or take any other enforcement action in respect of the occurrence and continuance of any existing events of default, or encourage any other person to take or initiate any such enforcement action or other action through the forbearance termination date as defined as   a  December 31, 2020  or any later date agreed to in writing by High Trail;  b  the occurrence of any event of default  other than an existing event of default ; and  c  the initiation of any action by the Company or any other person to invalidate or limit the enforceability of any of the acknowledgments set forth in the Forbearance Agreement. Subsequently, High Trail agreed to extend the forbearance termination date to March 31, 2021. The forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement has not been subsequently extended.  On May 24, 2020, the Company entered into a new forbearance agreement  the New Forbearance Agreement  with High Trail under which  i  the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements,  ii  High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of May 31, 2020 or any later date to which such date may be extended  the Outside Date , and the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the New Forbearance Agreement. The Outside Date automatically extends for successive two-week periods unless on or before the then-applicable Outside Date the lender provides notice that the Outside Date is not being extended.  As partial consideration for its agreement not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note and related documents, High Trail and the Company agreed to make certain changes to the documents. In this regard, the parties agreed to amend the Event of Default Acceleration Amount definition in the High Trail Note so that the amount due and payable by the Company on account of an event of default would be an amount in cash equal to 125  of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the High Trail Note. This represents an increase from 120  of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, and removes the market-price-based alternative for such acceleration amount.  Additionally, the parties also agreed that the principal amount outstanding under the High Trail Note would be increased by certain paid-in-kind amounts in full satisfaction of the Companys obligation to make payments of interest to High Trail on each of April 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021, which amounts were not paid by the Company in cash or Common Stock. In consideration of High Trails agreement to enter into the New Forbearance Agreement and agree to the amendments to the High Trail Note, the Company agreed to pay High Trail a fee in the amount of  1.5 million. Accordingly, following these increases in the principal amount payable, but applying against the outstanding principal and such fee the  6.0 million previously  maintained in a certain blocked account against that was foreclosed upon by High Trail, the total amount of principal outstanding under the High Trail Note as of the date of the New Forbearance Agreement was approximately  13.5 million.  On February 22, 2021, we issued a  2.4 million 8  Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note due 2025  the Senior Second Lien Note  to an institutional investor and received  2.0 million. The aggregate purchase price for the Senior Second Lien Note was  2.0 million. The Senior Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 The Senior Second Lien Note is secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries.  On April 29, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two initial investors and other investors as may become party thereto from time to time  collectively, the Second Lien Note Purchasers  providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to  6.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025  the Notes  and warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock  the April 2021 Warrants  to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. The Senior Second Lien Notes and accompanying April 2021 Warrants may be sold from time to time to one or more Second Lien Note Purchasers under the terms of the purchase agreement. On April 29, 2021, we closed on the sale of Senior Second Lien Notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately  1.79 million and April 2021 Warrants to purchase 1,490,000 shares of common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of  1.49 million.  Because of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, the limited amount of additional capital we have raised and can raise by selling the Senior Second Lien Notes and the foreclosure by High Trail on  6.0 million of the High Trail Note purchase price, we believe that we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the Senior Second Lien Note and any obligations under the High Trail Note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.  As a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Notes. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and or equity offerings and continue to work with High Trail to enter into a new forbearance arrangement or agree to restructure the indebtedness owed to High Trail. Accordingly, our management has been actively exploring these and other options for addressing our liquidity issues. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that High Trail will agree to forbear or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stocks delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.  Operating Activities  We reported net cash used in operating activities of  18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in operating activities of  17.8 million in 2019, an increase in cash used of  0.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities increased primarily as a result of the timing of payments to fund operations.     in thousands  2020 2019  Net loss    44,661     222,347   Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities  22,534 188,194   22,127   34,153   Changes in operating assets and liabilities  3,686 16,392  Net cash used in operating activities    18,441     17,761   Investing Activities  Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was  4.3 million, an increase of  15.4 million or 139 , compared to  11.1 million net cash used in investing activities in 2019. This increase in cash provided during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of proceeds received during 2020 for the sale of assets.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was  23.3 million, compared to  28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of a reduction in net cash proceeds during 2020 from the issuance of loans and redeemable preferred stock.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Purchase Commitment  During 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services  unconditional purchase obligations   see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies .  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Revenue Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenue  Revenue represents amounts earned for  non-software  arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenue is generally recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.  Monthly Service Revenue   The Companys performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service  SaaS  and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with true-up adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically significant.  Installation and Software Development Revenue   The Companys other revenue consist generally of installation and software development projects.  Installation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Companys monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.  Software development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customers existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.  Revenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.  Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations   The Companys contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.  Contract assets and liabilities   Given the nature of the Companys services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess of revenue when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.  Payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  We record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful.  Income Taxes  We estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.  We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.  Share-based Compensation  The Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation,  ASC 718 . ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, directors and non-employees to be recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss by measuring the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognizing this fair value as expense using a straight-line method over the requisite service period, generally the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and, if necessary, revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  The Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock-based payments that vest over time using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that impact the valuation of stock-based payments.  Warrant and Embedded Derivative Liabilities  Warrant and embedded derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party valuation expert to fair value these liabilities.  Business Combinations  We generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the acquisition method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially change our operating income and net income and result in different asset values on our balance sheet.  Significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment  Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment.  We test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a step two test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the period the impairment is recognized.  A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition.  In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment  ASC 360 , finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset.  Contingent Losses  From time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent matters. Litigation and regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
