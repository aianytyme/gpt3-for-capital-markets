MGT is comprised of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary MGT Sweden AB. MGT�s corporate office is in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Cryptocurrency Mining Business  Industry Summary  Bitcoin is a world-recognized cryptocurrency, which can be traded and converted into major fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a decentralized distributed ledger system, called the �Blockchain.� The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to the Blockchain. The processing power used to solve these mathematical problems is measured by Hash Rate or Hashes per second  �H s� . The complexity of these problems, also referred to as mining difficulty, increases with the network�s growing Hash Rate.  Bitcoin mining entails solving these complex mathematical problems using custom designed and programmed application-specific integrated circuit  �ASIC�  computers  also referred to as �miners� . Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees.  Additional information about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be found on publicly available educational sources such as www.Bitcoin.org.  Our Operations  Cryptocurrency mining  Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts  MW  of low-cost power.  The Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company  �Bitmain� , and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company�s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company�s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW.

The Company generates limited revenue from operations upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. The Company�s prospects must be considered keeping in mind the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a new business in a constantly changing industry. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve profitable operations in the foreseeable future, if at all.  The Company has identified several specific risk areas that may affect our operations and results in the future   Risks Related to Our Business  We have had limited commercial results and revenues, and we may be required to curtail operations if adequate funds are not available to us.  Our commercial results have been limited. Historically, the Company has not generated significant revenues to fund its operations, and the Company cannot be certain that revenues will be sufficient to fund operations for the foreseeable future. The Company�s primary source of operating funds since inception has been debt and equity financings. The Company has also earned a limited amount of revenue through its Bitcoin operations. At December 31, 2020, MGT�s cash and cash equivalents were approximately  236.  The Company may raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings, in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, no assurance can be provided that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance, moreover, that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations.

The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is presently using only a portion of the built-out available electrical load, it is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners.  Prior to establishing our Company-owned and managed facility, we conducted our Bitcoin mining operations through third-party hosting arrangements. We also entered into management agreements with third party investors whereby the investors purchased the mining hardware, and we received both a fee to manage the mining operations plus one-half of the net operating profit. In March 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to terminate our hosting agreement in Washington and conveyed ownership of its onsite mining assets for full satisfaction of  77 in outstanding hosting service fees. In August and September 2019, we terminated all our management agreements with third party investors, and in December 2019, we terminated our final remaining hosting arrangements in Colorado and Ohio.

The uncertainty surrounding the remaining duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic limits our ability to accurately forecast expected business results in the near term.  The health and safety of our employees and their families, our partners and our other constituents around the world is a high priority. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took action to enable our employees to work from home. We closed our offices  including our corporate headquarters , transitioned to a remote work environment, and implemented certain travel restrictions, each of which has changed how we operate our business. While a number of our offices have since reopened, most of our locations have limited access and few employees working on site. We continue to monitor and manage the situation, but as of now remote access remains the primary means of work for most of our workforce.  The COVID-19 outbreak and preventative measures taken to contain the COVID-19 outbreak continue to cause business slowdowns and shutdowns in affected areas. A majority of our customer events and those of our channel partners are virtual only experiences. These events may not be as successful as customer events prior to COVID-19 because, among other reasons, the limited number of such events, the varying attendance levels and virtual event fatigue.  An extended period of remote work arrangements negatively impacts the sales pipeline due to reduced, delayed, or altered sales and marketing interactions with customers and potential customers, expose us to increased risk of cyber incidents, delay or alter product roadmaps or research and development due to reduced or limited access to technologies, equipment, or services, and delay or disrupt recruitment efforts.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  If we fail to manage our transition to a more subscription-based business model successfully, our results of operations and or cash flows could be negatively impacted.  We are transitioning to a more subscription-based business model, which may have negative revenue and or cash flow implications. The subscription model prices and delivers our software differently than a perpetual license model. These changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales in favor of providing our clients the right to access our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. The potential shift of our clients� preference to a cloud-based subscription model requires a considerable investment of technical, financial, legal, managerial and sales resources, and a scalable organization.  Market acceptance of our subscription-based offering will depend on our ability to continue to   �innovate and include new functionality and improve the usability of our products in a manner that addresses our clients� needs and requirements; and  �optimally price our products in light of marketplace conditions, competition, our costs, and client demand.  Our cloud-based subscription model also requires that we rely on third parties to host our products for our clients. We incur significant recurring third-party hosting expenses to deliver our Pega Cloud offering that we do not incur for our perpetual and term license products. These expenses may cause the gross margin we realize from our Pega Cloud sales to be lower than the gross margin we realize from our perpetual and term license products. If we are unable to meet these challenges effectively, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  The transition to a subscription-based business model gives rise to several risks, including the following   �our revenues and cash flows may fluctuate more than anticipated in the near term;  �if the increased demand for our offerings does not continue, we could experience decreased profitability or losses and reduced or negative cash flow because of our continued significant investments in our Pega Cloud offering;  �if new or current clients desire only perpetual licenses, our subscription sales may lag behind our expectations;  �we may be unsuccessful in maintaining or implementing our target pricing or new pricing models, product adoption and projected renewal rates, or we may select a target price or new pricing model that is not optimal and could negatively affect our sales or earnings;  �if our clients do not renew their subscriptions, our revenue may decline, and our business may be materially adve"}

Risk Factors  While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.

These effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our operating and financial results in 2020 and will likely have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results over the next several quarters.  The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.  Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period and are difficult to predict.  Individual orders can represent a meaningful percentage of our revenues and operating results in any single quarter and the timing of the receipt of those orders is difficult to predict. The failure to close an order or the deferral or cancellation of an order can result in revenue and net income shortfalls for that quarter. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed. As a result, we may not be able to sufficiently reduce our costs in any quarter to adequately compensate for an unexpected near-term shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter.  Our financial results may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the following   �  the lack or reduction of government funding and the political, budgetary and purchasing constraints of government customers who purchase products and services directly or indirectly from us;  �  the terms of customer contracts that affect the timing of revenue recognition;  �  the size and timing of our receipt of customer orders;  �  significant fluctuations in demand for our products and services;  �  the loss of a key customer or one of its key customers;  �  new competitors, or the introduction of enhanced solutions from new or existing competitors;  �  competitive pressures on selling prices;  �  cancellations, delays or contract amendments by government customers;  �  higher than expe"}

Our software products are used in government and commercial systems and applications and fulfill a broad range of functions critical to secure biometric enrollment, authentication, identification and transactions. Principal government applications of biometrics systems include border control, visa applicant screening, law enforcement, national defense, intelligence, secure credentialing, access control, and background checks. Principal commercial applications include  i  user enrollment and authentication used for login to mobile devices, computers, networks, and software programs; ii  user authentication for financial transactions and purchases  online and in-person ; iii  physical access control to buildings; and iv  identity proofing of prospective employees and customers. We sell our biometrics software products and services globally through a multifaceted distribution strategy using systems integrators, OEMs, VARs, partners, and directly to end user customers. We also derive a portion of our revenue from the sale of imaging software licenses to OEMs and systems integrators that incorporate our software into medical imaging products and medical systems.  Summary of Financial Results  We used revenue and operating loss to summarize financial results over the past two years as we believe these measurements are the most meaningful way to understand our operating performance.  2020 compared to 2019  Revenue and operating loss in 2020 were  11.3 million and  9.4 million, respectively, which compared to revenue and operating loss in 2019 of  12.2 million and  4.1 million, respectively.  Lower revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower services revenue related to a software license agreement, we entered with a systems integrator in the second quarter of 2018 for a large project where we performed significantly more services in 2019 as compared to 2020. This was partially offset by higher subscription revenue. Lower operating income in 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily due to  i  lower revenue in 2020; and ii  higher total costs and expenses in 2020.

You should read these risk factors in conjunction with �Management�s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations� in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Item 8. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.  Risks Related to Our Business  We have a history of operating and net losses.  We have experienced significant operating and net losses since we began operations. After years of losses, we had net income for 2019 of  554,300 and 2020 of  693,700; however, such improvement in our financial performance could reverse if our GO-Global business, our only source of revenue, declines or if we are unable to maintain control over our expenses.  The coronavirus pandemic could adversely affect our results of operations.  The recent coronavirus pandemic throughout the United States and the world has resulted in the United States and other countries halting or sharply curtailing the movement of people, goods and services. All of this has caused extended shutdowns of businesses and the prolonged economic impact remains uncertain. At this point, we believe the conditions will have a material adverse effect on our business but given the rapidly changing developments we cannot accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our business, which will depend on, among other factors, the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the duration of the outbreak and travel restrictions and business closures imposed by the United States and various other governments.  Our revenue is typically generated from a limited number of resellers.  A material portion of our revenue, all of which is currently derived from our GO-Global products, during any reporting period is typically generated from a limited number of resellers in certain countries or geographic regions, all of which are unrelated third parties. We are seeking to expand the number of resellers of our GO-Global products to grow our revenues and diversify our revenue geographically. However, our inability to expand the number of resellers and or a reduction in the orders from our current resellers could materially adversely impact our revenues.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes provided in Item 8 �Financial Statements and Supplementary Data� in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hopTo Inc. and its subsidiaries  collectively, �we�, �us�, �our�, or �Company� ; significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  �GAAP�  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include  the amount of stock-based compensation expense; the allowance for doubtful accounts; the estimated lives of property of equipment, valuation and amortization of intangible assets  including capitalized software ; depreciation of long-lived assets; valuation of warrants; post-employment benefits; and accruals for liabilities, deferred rent, and taxes. While the Company believes that such estimates are fair, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before investing in our common stock. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described below occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, causing you to lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also affect our business and results of operations.  Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital  We have incurred net losses since our inception and may never be profitable.  Our likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with development of a business enterprise in the technology sector. Our net losses for the year ended September 30, 2021 were  3,104,283, and for the year ended September 30, 2020 were  6,970,072, respectively, and our aggregate accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2021 was  71,530,891.  We cannot assure you that that any of our products currently under development will be successfully commercialized, and the extent of our future losses and the timing of our profitability, if ever achieved, are highly uncertain. If we are unable to achieve profitability, we may be unable to continue our operations.  Our ability to continue as a going concern may depend upon our ability to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.  We may need to raise additional funds in order to support expansion, develop new or enhanced services and products, hire employees, respond to competitive pressures, acquire technologies or respond to unanticipated requirements, provided that we currently believe that funds from our recent private placement will allow us to support our operations until approximately September of 2023. Our management�s plans include attempting to improve our profitability and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs on a timely basis, obtaining additional working capital funds through equity and debt financing arrangements, and restructuring on-going operations to eliminate inefficiencies to increase our cash balances. However, we cannot assure you that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient to fund our ongoing capital expenditures, working capital, and other requirements.

MANAGEMENT�S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our Business  We are developing products and services around our patented polymorphic encryption technology, which is designed to enable secure and private data transmission. Through a licensing program, we are offering our Polymorphic Encryption Core, or PEC, which we believe to be the first secure commercially viable, advanced polymorphic data-in-motion product that is designed to be used in any commercial data security industry or in sensitive applications. To supplement our potential licensing revenue, we are building our own applications that leverage our PEC. We believe that our innovative and patented polymorphic technology provides resistant and performant solutions to the problem of quantum cracking through rapid deployment of our quantum encryption algorithm, which has been approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  We anticipate that our operating expenses for the next twelve months will require between  2.5 and  3.5 million of cash, which will come from the net proceeds we received from a private placement of our securities held between March 31, 2021 and April 16, 2021. We intend to manage our business such that our current cash reserves will allow us to reach positive cash flow from our operations, but we cannot assure you that will occur. Our proposed approach to managing our cash will initially emphasize demonstrating our products� capabilities with our current customers. We will follow those efforts with using our remaining cash to scale all of our functional areas, including product development, marketing, sales, customer support, and administration.  We intend to focus our product development efforts on building new software and services to work with our existing core technology, while continuing to support our existing licensees. These efforts will require more personnel, as well as more infrastructure. We expect the increase in product development activities will require approximately  1.0 million of our cash over the next 12 months.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  We are a leading SaaS provider of voice, video, contact center, and communication APIs powered by a global cloud communications platform. From our proprietary cloud technology platform, organizations across all their locations and employees have access to unified communications, team collaboration, video conferencing, contact center, data and analytics, communication APIs, and other services, enabling them to be more productive and responsive to their customers.  Our customers range from small businesses to large enterprises and their users are spread across more than 150 countries. In recent years, we have increased our up-market focus on the mid-market and enterprise customer sectors.  We have a portfolio of cloud-based offerings that are subscription based, made available at different rates varying by the specific functionalities, services and number of users. We generate service revenue from communications services subscriptions and platform usage. We generate other revenue from professional services and the sale of office phones and other hardware equipment. We define a �customer� as one or more legal entities to which we provide services pursuant to a single contractual arrangement. In some cases, we may have multiple billing relationships with a single customer  for example, where we establish separate billing accounts for a parent company and each of its subsidiaries .  Our flagship service is our 8x8 X Series, a suite of UCaaS and CCaaS solutions, which consist of service plans of increasing functionality designated X1, X2, etc., through X8. With 8x8 X Series, we provide enterprise-grade voice, unified communications, video meetings, team collaboration, and contact center functionalities from a single platform. We also offer standalone SaaS services for contact center, video meetings, and enterprise communication APIs. Through our July 2019 acquisition of Wavecell Pte. Ltd., an Asia-based global communication platform as a service CPaaS provider of SMS, messaging, voice and video APIs to enterprises, we expanded our API offerings both geographically and in scope. We expect to continue integrating these services into our platform, as we believe in the value of the collective solutions.  Throughout fiscal 2021, the Company incurred professional services and related engineering costs to upgrade our customers to the 8x8 X Series platform. As of March 31, 2021, we have upgraded substantially all of our customers to X Series, and intend to complete remaining upgrades in fiscal 2022. While we may not be able to recover these costs from our customers, we believe that we will realize other benefits including reducing the number of platforms that we are required to support and improved customer retention.

Risk Factors  The following is a discussion of the material factors that make an investment in the Company and its securities speculative or risky. The risks described herein are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry  Demand for our software solutions is subject to volatility in our accounts� underlying businesses, which includes infrastructure projects that typically have long timelines.  Our sales are based significantly on accounts� demand for software solutions in the following infrastructure sectors   i  public works utilities;  ii  industrial resources; and  iii  commercial facilities. Although these sectors are typically countercyclical to one another in nature, each periodically experiences economic declines and may be exacerbated by other economic factors. If participants in any of these sectors reduce spending or allocate future funding in a manner that results in fewer infrastructure improvement or expansion projects, then our accounts� underlying business may be impacted and demand for our software solutions may decrease or our rate of contract renewals may decrease. A prolonged decrease in such spending may harm our results of operations. Our accounts may request discounts or extended payment terms on new arrangements or seek to extend payment terms on existing arrangements due to lower levels of infrastructure spending or for other reasons, all of which may reduce revenue. We may not be able to adjust our operating expenses to offset such discounts or other arrangements because a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel, facilities, and marketing programs. The level of personnel and related expenses may not be able to be adjusted quickly and is based, in significant part, on our expectations for future revenues and demand.  Infrastructure projects typically have long timelines and we may invest in building capacity based on expected demand for our software solutions that takes longer to develop than we expect or fails to develop at all. Additionally, government spending on infrastructure may decrease, which could decrease the demand for our software solutions and have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be successful in forecasting future demand levels and could fail to win business at the expected rates. If we underestimate the demand for our software solutions, we may be unable to fulfill the increased demand in a timely fashion or at all. If we overestimate the demand for our software solutions, we may incur additional expenses for which we would not have corresponding revenues, negatively impacting our results of operations.

You should consider the risk factors described below before investing in our stock as such risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause the price of our stock to decline. Please note that the risk factors described below are not exhaustive.  Risks Related to Our Company  A significant portion of our revenue is derived from subscription and maintenance renewals with our existing customers.  Subscription and maintenance renewals are at the customer�s discretion, and customers may elect not to renew or renew at a lower annual renewal value than the prior year. Further, it is our strategy to convert existing customers to our cloud services offering, which, if successful, will reduce maintenance revenue. If our existing customers discontinue maintenance or subscription to a significant degree, our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected. Our cloud customers have the option to renew a lower number of users and or a reduced number of modules which would also have a negative impact on revenue and results of operations.  We have risks regarding our pricing and pricing models.  We are occasionally obliged to offer deep discounts and other favorable terms in order to match or exceed the product and service offerings of our competitors. Furthermore, we may be faced with general downward pricing pressure from competitors and the market in the future. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused downward pricing pressure from customers requesting additional discounts or other pricing concessions. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer demand resulting from rapid technological advances, such as those leading to alternative hosting and cloud service delivery offerings, our revenues could decrease. For example, if customer software usage evolves in ways that maintain or increase the value they derive from our products while decreasing traditional licensing metrics, such as individual users, and if we do not adjust our pricing models accordingly, then our revenues could decrease. Further, broad-based changes to our pricing models could adversely affect our revenues and operating results if our sales force is not able to successfully sell the new pricing models to new customers or transition existing customers to the new pricing models effectively. Failed pricing models and our inability to establish or maintain standalone selling prices  SSP  may result in negative revenue recognition impacts.  Risks associated with our solutions.  Our solutions, including licensed software, cloud services and other services, may contain defects, including security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released.

COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Impact  In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized a novel strain of coronavirus  COVID-19  as a pandemic. In response to the pandemic, the United States and various foreign, state and local governments have, among other actions, imposed travel and business restrictions and required or advised communities in which we do business to adopt stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines, causing some businesses to adjust, reduce or suspend  operating activities. The pandemic and the various governments� response have caused significant and widespread uncertainty, volatility and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, including in the regions in which we operate.  Financial Results and Outlook  Beginning in the Summer of 2020 and continuing through the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced lengthened sales cycles and reduced demand for some of our security solutions due to economic uncertainty connected with the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant impact of the pandemic on our business has been a sharp drop in demand for our hardware authentication products and delays in the implementation of certain software security solutions.

If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results, and the trading price of our common stock, could be materially harmed.  Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic  Our operating plans and financial condition have been adversely affected by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to experience continued adverse effects in future periods in connection with the ongoing public health and safety, governmental, and economic implications.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. As the virus spread throughout 2020, across the U.S. and the world, authorities implemented numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations, and shutdowns. In addition to the pandemic's widespread impact on public health and global society, reactions to the pandemic as well as measures taken to contain the virus initially caused significant turmoil to the global economy and financial markets. To address the public health and safety concerns, we have taken steps to support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, which include working remotely and learning to operate our businesses in a fundamentally different way.  To date, we have had to change certain strategy and product plans in order to address implications of the pandemic to our businesses, in particular, to our growth initiatives. Although forced to furlough some employees in the early days of the pandemic, we were able to bring those employees back to work during the second quarter of 2020. We also reduced expenditures during the year in an effort to efficiently manage our businesses in the restricted and uncertain climate, although we continue to face risk related to fixed facilities costs given the uncertain post-pandemic future of the use of physical office space. In addition, the initial turmoil in financial markets contributed to significant downward pressure on our stock price early in the pandemic. We cannot provide assurance that the actions we have taken will be sufficient, or that conditions will improve as the pandemic, and reactions thereto, continue to evolve.

We also generate revenue from the sale of our PC-based RealPlayer products, including RealPlayer Plus and related products.

Our Mobile Services business generates revenue primarily from the sale of subscription services, which include our intercarrier messaging service and ringback tones, as well as through software licenses for the integration of our RealTimes platform and certain system implementations. We generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales within our Mobile Services business to a few mobile carriers. Our Mobile Services segment also includes our computer vision platform, SAFR, which includes facial recognition technology that leverages artificial intelligence-based machine learning.  Our Games business generates revenue primarily through the development, publishing, and distribution of casual games under the GameHouse and Zylom brands. Games are offered via mobile devices, digital downloads, and subscription play. We derive revenue from player purchases of in-game virtual goods within our free-to-play games and from advertising on games sites. In addition, we derive revenue from the sale of individual games and subscription offerings.

We also offer MicroStrategy Consulting� and MicroStrategy Education� to help customers deploy, optimize, and manage their analytics initiatives.  We also pursue a business strategy of acquiring bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes.  We believe that bitcoin is attractive because it can serve as a store of value, supported by a robust and public open source architecture, that is untethered to sovereign monetary policy and can therefore serve as a hedge against inflation. We also believe that bitcoin offers additional opportunity for appreciation in value with increasing adoption due to its limited supply. In addition, we believe that our bitcoin strategy is complementary to our analytics software and services business, as we believe that our bitcoin and related activities in support of the bitcoin network enhance awareness of our brand and can provide opportunities to secure new customers for our analytics offerings. We are also exploring opportunities to apply bitcoin related technologies such as blockchain analytics into our software offerings.

Bsquare is meeting those demands, making intelligent systems possible. We believe our technology is making people more productive, improving quality of life, and reducing demands on the resources of our planet.

Risks Related to General Business Conditions  If we are not successful in developing and delivering competitive product and services offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs, or if our products and services fail to gain or maintain traction with potential customers, our business would be negatively impacted.  Throughout 2020, we continued to update our product strategy to bring to market technologies and related services that build on our history of helping our customers deploy and operate intelligent devices.

Our strategy to focus on the IoT market is subject to a number of additional risks and the occurrence of any of them could harm our business   �  The significant investment of time and financial and other corporate resources required;  �  Customer acceptance of our IoT-related product and service offerings;  �  Our ability to cross sell customers;  �  The ROI model for IoT, which has proven to be elusive for many customers, could further delay adoption of IoT solutions by the market;  �  Because IoT services are a relatively new offering, the sales cycle may be longer than we anticipate, and;  �  We may be unable to grow our IoT-related services business rapidly enough to reach profitability in 2021.

The occurrence of adverse events described in the following risk factors or other adverse events not described in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.  Risks Related to Our Business  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, and the disease it causes, COVID-19, a pandemic. The pandemic continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures from time to time to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to completely predict the full impact that COVID-19 and related remedial measures will have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, our compliance with these measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time.  The negative effects of COVID-19 on the overall economy could cause our revenues and profitability to decline for numerous reasons, including   �  Our customers could implement cost-saving measures, which may include reductions in information technology expense or requests for extended payment terms;  �  Some customers could file for bankruptcy;  �  Forced store closures could accelerate pre-existing disruption in the retail sector; and or  �  The spending habits of our customers� customers could change, reducing our customers� own revenues and profitability, which in turn could affect our revenues and profitability.  While we have experienced strong demand during 2020 and expect continued growth for our Cloud solutions, sales cycles could extend as our customers and prospects continue to evaluate our solutions, including Manhattan Active Warehouse Management.  In addition, restrictions on in-person interaction, whether occasioned by government orders or changed habits or customs regarding social distancing and group activity after the expiration of strict government measures, may have a material impact on our business. For instance, implementation of our software may be impeded if either our personnel or our customer�s information technology personnel are working remotely.

More than one hundred eighty leading brands use eGain�s cloud software to improve customer satisfaction, empower agents, reduce service cost, and boost sales.  Industry Background  Introduction  Customer relationship management  CRM  tools are not designed to serve as systems of engagement because they are primarily systems of record. They do not offer rich applications to engage customers across digital touch points, nor do they escalate conversations with context across self-service to agent assistance. Furthermore, CRM systems mostly view knowledge management as traditional document management - a big content model that does not work the personalized, media-rich, and content-heavy digital world. Frontline agents, in the CRM worldview, are supposed to have super-human capacity to retain and routinely refresh all relevant knowhow across complex, expanding product portfolios and compliance-heavy processes. Finally, the concept of in-band guidance for customer self-service and agent assistance is foreign to CRM systems. The reality of CRM desktops in contact centers today, we believe, is that agents ignore 90  of the data piled up their application screens-most of which is hidden behind multiple tabs. According to Gartner, 84  of agents surveyed are not satisfied with their desktop tools. It is time to reimagine the Agent Experience.  Digital Economy Demands Modern Software  In a world selling commoditized products to information-rich customers short on time, smart engagement must automate the routine and augment the interesting across agent, business and customer. Therefore, businesses are increasingly seeking digital-first, modern software platforms to layer on top of their traditional systems like CRM, contact centers, and content management. Customer engagement platforms must be designed to be systems of engagement, enabling rapid innovation, delivering quick value and integrating with systems of record across the enterprise. Agile, comprehensive, scalable, and cost-effective, they must demonstrably automate customer self-service, empower agents and easily orchestrate contact center operation in an omnichannel environment.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. However, for the reasons described below, we do not believe that cash on hand and cash flow generated internally by us will be adequate to fund our limited overhead and other cash requirements beyond the next twelve months. These reasons raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our significant net losses, working capital deficit and need to raise additional capital, which as it noted raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

On a short term liquidity basis, we must receive capital contributions or loans from Delfin or its affiliates in order to continue as a going concern. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, based upon our current financial condition as discussed above, we believe that we will need to raise additional debt or equity capital in order for us to continue to operate as a going concern on a long-term basis. Any such capital would likely come from Delfin, as we currently have no access to credit facilities and have traditionally relied on borrowings from related parties to meet short-term liquidity needs. Any equity capital raised may result in substantial dilution in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, par value  0.001 per share  �Common Stock� . We intend to use the proceeds from the 2018 Promissory Note and seek other loans from Delfin and related entities, if necessary, to fund our public company operating costs while we explore our options related to the future of theglobe.  Through December 2020, we borrowed a total of  600,000 under an amended and restated promis"}
{"prompt":"","completion":"THEGLOBE COM INC:Item 7. MANAGEMENT�S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview   As a shell company, we currently have no material operations or assets.  Basis of Presentation of Financial Statements; Going Concern  We received a report from our independent registered public accountants, relating to our December 31, 2020 audited financial statements, containing an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. As a shell company, our management believes that we will not be able to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund our operations and pay our existing current liabilities in the foreseeable future. Based upon our current limited cash resources and without the infusion of additional capital and or the continued forbearance of our creditors, our management does not believe we can operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. See �Future and Critical Need for Capital� section of this Management�s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.  Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.  All Note references relate to accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.  Results of Operations  Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019  Net Revenue  Commensurate with the sale of our Tralliance business on September 29, 2008, we became a shell company, and have not had any material operations since then. As a result, net revenue was  0 for both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  General and Administrative  General and administrative expenses include only those customary public company expenses, including outside legal and audit fees, insurance and other related public company costs. General and administrative expenses totaled approximately  118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and  178,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to less legal fees and no proxy mailing fees in the current year as compared to prior year.  Related Party Interest Expense  Related party interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately  46,000 and  34,000, respectively, and consisted of interest due and payable to Delfin under the Bridge Note. The increase is due to an increase in the amount of money borrowed from Delfin.  Net Loss  Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately  164,000 as compared to a net loss of approximately  211,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our business, operating results and financial condition. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impact our business operations.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.  Risks Related To COVID-19  Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic  The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows and our financial condition. Global health concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions have caused significant disruption to the global economic environment and increased economic uncertainty. There are growing, recent uncertainties related to the evolution of the pandemic itself, including the impact of disease variants, the effectiveness of vaccines against these variants and the consequence to unvaccinated individuals. In response, restrictions have started to be re-implemented by various government bodies and private businesses. There is no recent, comparable event that provides guidance on the myriad of impacts that COVID-19 may ultimately have, however its impact on market and economic conditions clearly remains a significant risk. The long-term consequences of the pandemic remain difficult to predict and depend in large part on the duration of the pandemic and any future recurrence of outbreak, further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers, the demand for our products and our ability to sell and provide new goods and services, including as a result of travel restrictions, employees working from home and other factors. Our customers may also slow-down decision making in respect of new purchases, delay work that had previously been scheduled or seek price concessions or modified payment terms in responses to strains on their own businesses.  Since March 2020 we have continued to take proactive measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees including suspending travel worldwide, temporarily closing our offices and requiring employees to work remotely. While we believe we are currently operating our business effectively in spite of these challenges, substantially all of our employees continue to work remotely.

RISK FACTORS  Our business and future operating results may be affected by many risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth below and those contained elsewhere in this report. If any of the following risks were to occur, our business, affairs, assets, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. When we say that something could have a material adverse effect on us or on our business, we mean that it could have one or more of these effects.  In addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company. Our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  Risks Relating to Our Business  We have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic  COVID-19  and related governmental actions and orders and market effects.  The coronavirus pandemic  COVID-19  and related economic downturn continues to pose various and interrelated risks to our customers, our employees, our vendors and the communities in which we operate, which have all negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our business. From March 24, 2020 to June 15, 2020, we were obligated to scale back operations in our Graphic Sciences operations, due to Michigan stay-at-home orders, which permitted us to process only those projects qualifying as essential under the state guidance. We resumed operating at full capacity thereafter, but we were unable to make up our ordinary level of revenues in the remainder of 2020 to offset the period in which our operations were reduced. In addition, our biggest customer, the State of Michigan, has not fully resumed its own operations, resulting in a decreased volume of work orders for our Document Conversion segment. Since the stay-at-home order was lifted in June, 2020, through December 31, 2020, Document Conversion segment delivered 89  of 2019 revenues for the same seven months. In addition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we suffer one or several COVID-19 outbreaks in our facilities or if the State of Michigan issues new stay-at-home orders in the future. We are also likely to be impacted further by decreased customer demand and or subscription terminations as a result of a reduction in customer spending  especially customers that are state and local governmental entities  or as a result of government-imposed restrictions on businesses. In particular, governmental budget reductions in the State of Michigan, our largest customer, may have a material adverse effect on our business. Finally, due to the portion of our business that generates subscription-based revenue, the effect of COVID-19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods.

Risks Related to Our Business and Our Financial Reporting  We are involved and will continue to be involved in litigation defending our patent portfolio, which can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot anticipate the results.  We spend a significant amount of our financial and management resources to pursue our current litigation. We believe that this litigation and others that we may pursue in the future could continue for years and consume significant financial and management resources.

Risks Related to Our Business  The restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in Amendment No. 1 to our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K A and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, stockholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.  On October 21, 2019, our board of directors determined that the Company�s financial statements that were included in its annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018 and quarterly reports for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019  collectively, the �Non-Reliance Periods�  should no longer be relied upon.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods in 2019.

Likewise, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we have become subject to, and could also be subject to additional, stockholder, governmental, regulatory or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters.
