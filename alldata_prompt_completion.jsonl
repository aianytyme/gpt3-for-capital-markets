MGT is comprised of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary MGT Sweden AB. MGT�s corporate office is in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Cryptocurrency Mining Business  Industry Summary  Bitcoin is a world-recognized cryptocurrency, which can be traded and converted into major fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a decentralized distributed ledger system, called the �Blockchain.� The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to the Blockchain. The processing power used to solve these mathematical problems is measured by Hash Rate or Hashes per second  �H s� . The complexity of these problems, also referred to as mining difficulty, increases with the network�s growing Hash Rate.  Bitcoin mining entails solving these complex mathematical problems using custom designed and programmed application-specific integrated circuit  �ASIC�  computers  also referred to as �miners� . Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees.  Additional information about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be found on publicly available educational sources such as www.Bitcoin.org.  Our Operations  Cryptocurrency mining  Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts  MW  of low-cost power.  The Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company  �Bitmain� , and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company�s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company�s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW. The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is"}

We also offer MicroStrategy Consulting� and MicroStrategy Education� to help customers deploy, optimize, and manage their analytics initiatives.  We also pursue a business strategy of acquiring bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes.  We believe that bitcoin is attractive because it can serve as a store of value, supported by a robust and public open source architecture, that is untethered to sovereign monetary policy and can therefore serve as a hedge against inflation. We also believe that bitcoin offers additional opportunity for appreciation in value with increasing adoption due to its limited supply.

More than one hundred eighty leading brands use eGain�s cloud software to improve customer satisfaction, empower agents, reduce service cost, and boost sales.  Industry Background  Introduction  Customer relationship management  CRM  tools are not designed to serve as systems of engagement because they are primarily systems of record. They do not offer rich applications to engage customers across digital touch points, nor do they escalate conversations with context across self-service to agent assistance. Furthermore, CRM systems mostly view knowledge management as traditional document management - a big content model that does not work the personalized, media-rich, and content-heavy digital world. Frontline agents, in the CRM worldview, are supposed to have super-human capacity to retain and routinely refresh all relevant knowhow across complex, expanding product portfolios and compliance-heavy processes. Finally, the concept of in-band guidance for customer self-service and agent assistance is foreign to CRM systems. The reality of CRM desktops in contact centers today, we believe, is that agents ignore 90  of the data piled up their application screens-most of which is hidden behind multiple tabs. According to Gartner, 84  of agents surveyed are not satisfied with their desktop tools. It is time to reimagine the Agent Experience.  Digital Economy Demands Modern Software  In a world selling commoditized products to information-rich customers short on time, smart engagement must automate the routine and augment the interesting across agent, business and customer. Therefore, businesses are increasingly seeking digital-first, modern software platforms to layer on top of their traditional systems like CRM, contact centers, and content management. Customer engagement platforms must be designed to be systems of engagement, enabling rapid innovation, delivering quick value and integrating with systems of record across the enterprise. Agile, comprehensive, scalable, and cost-effective, they must demonstrably automate customer self-service, empower agents and easily orchestrate contact center operation in an omnichannel environment.

Business  Overview:   SPS Commerce is a leading provider of cloud-based supply chain management services that make it easier for retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms to orchestrate the management of item data, order fulfillment, inventory control, and sales analytics across all channels. Implementing and maintaining a suite of supply chain management capabilities is resource-intensive and is not a core competency for most businesses.  The services offered by SPS Commerce eliminate the need for on-premise software and support staff by taking on that capability on the customer�s behalf. The services SPS Commerce provides enable our customers to increase their supply cycle agility, optimize their inventory levels and sell-through, reduce operational costs and gain increased visibility into customer orders, ensuring that suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms can satisfy exacting retailer requirements.  As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 33,000 customers with contracts to pay us monthly fees, which we refer to as recurring revenue customers. We have also generated revenues by providing our cloud-based supply chain management services to an additional 62,000 organizations that, together with our recurring revenue customers, we refer to as our customers. Once connected to the SPS Commerce cloud-based Platform, our customers often require integrations to new organizations that represent an expansion of our cloud-based Platform and new sources of revenues for us.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we generated revenues of  312.6 million,  279.1 million, and  248.2 million, respectively. Our quarter ended December 31, 2020 represented our 80th consecutive quarter of increased revenues. Recurring revenues from recurring revenue customers accounted for 94 , 94  and 93  of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our revenues are not concentrated with any customer, as our largest customer represented less than 1  of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.  Our Solutions  SPS Commerce operates one of the largest retail trading partner networks in the world through cloud-based services that improve the way retailers, suppliers, grocers, distributors, and logistics firms manage and fulfill orders, administer sell-through performance, and source new items.

Business  Overview:   LivePerson, Inc.  �LivePerson�, the �Company�, �we� or �our�  makes life easier for people and brands everywhere through trusted Conversational AI. Conversational AI allows humans and machines to interact using natural language, including speech or text. During the past decade, consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made mobile messaging the center of communication with friends, family and peers. This trend has been significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and can now be viewed as a permanent, structural shift in consumer behavior. Our technology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa. These messaging conversations harness human agents, bots and Artificial Intelligence  AI  to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, from discovery and research, to sales, service and support, and increasingly marketing, social, and brick and mortar engagements. For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel. These AI and human-assisted conversational experiences constitute the Conversational Space, within which LivePerson has strategically developed one of the industry's largest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases.  The Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to become conversational by securely deploying AI-powered messaging at scale for brands with tens of millions of customers and many thousands of agents. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand�s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, short message service  SMS , social media and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate interactive voice response systems  IVRs  and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.

Business  Overview:   We are a pioneer and leading provider of a cloud-based platform delivering information technology  IT , security and compliance solutions. Our integrated suite of IT, security and compliance solutions delivered on our Qualys Cloud Platform enables our customers to  1  identify and manage their IT assets across on-premises, endpoints, cloud, containers, and mobile environments; 2  collect and analyze large amounts of IT security data; 3  discover and prioritize vulnerabilities; 4  recommend and implement remediation actions; and 5  verify the implementation of such actions. This helps organizations protect their systems and applications from ever-evolving cyber-attacks and helps achieve compliance with internal policies and external regulations.  Our cloud solutions address the growing IT, security and compliance complexities and risks that are amplified by the dissolving boundaries between internal and external IT infrastructures and web environments, the rapid adoption of cloud computing, containers and serverless IT models, and the proliferation of geographically dispersed IT assets. Organizations use our integrated suite of solutions to cost-effectively obtain a unified view of their IT asset inventory as well as security and compliance posture across globally-distributed IT infrastructures as our solution offers a single platform for information technology, information security, application security, endpoint, developer security and cloud teams.  IT infrastructures are more complex and globally-distributed today than ever before, as organizations of all sizes increasingly rely upon a myriad of interconnected information systems and related IT assets, such as servers, databases, web applications, routers, switches, desktops, laptops, other physical and virtual infrastructure, and numerous external networks and cloud services. In this environment, new and evolving digital technologies intended to improve organizations� operations can also increase vulnerability to cyber-attacks, which can expose sensitive data, damage IT and physical infrastructures, and result in serious financial or reputational consequences. In addition, the rapidly increasing amount of data and devices in IT environments makes it more difficult to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in a timely manner. The predominant approach to IT security has been to implement multiple disparate security products that can be costly and difficult to deploy, integrate and manage and may not adequately protect organizations. As a result, we believe there is a large and growing opportunity for comprehensive cloud-based IT, security and compliance solutions delivered in a single platform.

Our software helps companies drive mission critical business processes such as pricing, quoting, contracting, regulatory compliance, rebates and incentives. With deep industry expertise, Model N supports the complex business needs of the world�s leading brands in life sciences and high tech including Johnson   Johnson, AstraZeneca, Stryker, Seagate Technology, Broadcom, and Microchip Technology.  Historically, companies tended to rely on a disjointed patchwork of manual processes, spreadsheets, point applications, and legacy systems to manage their revenue processes. These processes and systems operated in isolation from one another and were labor intensive, error prone, inflexible, and costly, often resulting in missed revenue opportunities, suboptimal margins, incentive overpayments, and increased revenue compliance risk. Current industry trends, which include shortening product lifecycles, tightening compliance and regulatory controls, increasing channel complexity and growing volumes of transactional data, are causing these outdated processes and legacy systems to become increasingly ineffective.  Our expertise in cloud-based revenue management solutions, combined with our knowledge of the life sciences and high tech industries, has enabled us to develop software designed to meet the unique, strategic needs of these industries, such as managed care and government pricing for life sciences companies and channel incentives management for high tech companies. Model N Revenue Cloud transforms the revenue lifecycle into a strategic, end-to-end process aligned across the enterprise. Our industry specific solution suites - Revenue Cloud for Life Sciences and Revenue Cloud for High Tech - offer a range of solutions from individual products to complete product suites.

We have achieved our leadership position by combining over twenty years of deep domain expertise with the differentiated SaaS capabilities and low-code configurability of our technology platform. We believe we are the first company to provide carriers with an end-to-end suite of enterprise-scale core system software that is purpose-built as a SaaS solution. Our product portfolio is built on our modern technology foundation, the Duck Creek Platform, and works cohesively to improve the operational efficiency of insurers� core processes  policy administration, claims management and billing  as well as other critical functions. The Duck Creek Platform enables our customers to be agile and rapidly capitalize on market opportunities, while reducing their total cost of technology ownership.  The core business functions of insurers are complex and data intensive, typically requiring large ongoing investments in domain specific technology. Heightened end-user expectations, increased competition, and new and evolving risks pose new challenges for carriers, creating the need for software that fosters agility, innovation and speed to market. However, a large portion of the P C insurance market continues to rely on legacy technology systems that are costly and inefficient to maintain, difficult to upgrade, and lacking in functional flexibility. In recent years, some carriers have turned to newer alternatives to legacy systems. These systems have been designed for on-premise environments and lack the inherent benefits of purpose-built SaaS solutions, perpetuating the limitations, inflexibility and cost of utilizing legacy systems. By contrast, our SaaS solutions, offered via Duck Creek OnDemand, accelerate carriers� agility and speed to market by enabling rapid, low-code product development, and protecting carriers� unique content configurations and integrations while providing upgrades and updates via continuous delivery. We have developed a substantial SaaS customer base and believe that we have established a meaningful first-mover advantage by demonstrating the superiority of SaaS solutions for core systems in the P C insurance industry. We began offering SaaS solutions for core systems in the P C insurance industry in 2013 and signed our first customer in 2014. We believe competitors will have to make significant investments of time and resources in order to offer similar SaaS products.  Our deep understanding of the P C insurance industry has enabled us to develop a unified suite of insurance software products tailored to address the key challenges faced by carriers worldwide. Our solutions promote insurers� nimbleness by enabling rapid integration and streamlining the ability to capture, access and utilize data more effectively.

{"prompt":"", "completion":"Riot Blockchain, Inc.:ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview:   We are one of the leading Nasdaq publicly traded cryptocurrency mining companies operating in North America. We have made the strategic decision to focus our efforts on mining bitcoin by deploying special cryptocurrency mining computers  known in the industry as �miners�  designed to mine for bitcoin. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we exclusively operated the Antminer series of miners manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Limited  �Bitmain�  to mine bitcoin and, to a much lesser extent, litecoin. We generate substantially all our revenue through our cryptocurrency mining operation. We generate revenue from the cryptocurrency we earn through our mining activities, which we may hold for our own account and or sell at prices and times as determined by our executive management team in accordance with our corporate strategy. The Company is also exploring innovative cryptocurrency mining technologies and other strategic initiatives as part of a continual effort to maximize the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of its cryptocurrency mining activities.  Cryptocurrency Mining  We seek to mine bitcoin by using our miners to solve complex cryptographic algorithms to support the Bitcoin blockchain  in a process known as �solving a block� . In return for solving a block, we receive a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency reward, depending on the blockchain, which we hold for our account and attempt to sell on the market to generate a profit.  Miners measure their capability in terms of processing power, which is known as in the industry as �hashing� power. Hashing power is measured in terms of the number of hashing algorithms solved  or �hashes�  per second, which is the miner�s �hash rate.� Generally speaking, miners with greater hashing power relative to other miners attempting to solve a block have a higher chance of solving the block and receiving a cryptocurrency award. However, although newer generations of miners advertise improved energy efficiency, we have observed that increasing hash rate generally requires greater electrical power, which increases the cost of solving a block and, therefore, the relative cost of mining a cryptocurrency. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals found that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started organizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool.  Participation in Mining Pools  A �mining pool� is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the amount of hashing power they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and available hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain."}

Our integrated suite of products works together to help organizations build people-centric security and compliance programs. We provide threat protection, information protection, user protection, business ecosystem protection, and compliance solutions to address today�s rapidly changing threat and compliance landscape. Our solutions are built on a flexible, cloud-based platform and leverage proprietary technologies - including big data analytics, machine learning, deep content inspection, secure storage, advanced encryption, intelligent message routing, dynamic malware analysis, threat correlation, and virtual execution environments.  Every company�s greatest asset and greatest security risk is its people. Cyberattacks have fundamentally shifted from targeting infrastructure to targeting people, relying on tricking users into running code, divulging their passwords, or even sending money or data. This transformation of the threat landscape manifests in nearly every form of cyber threat, from nation state advanced persistent threat  �APT�  actors relying on phishing, through to cybercriminals launching massive ransomware email campaigns, and more targeted campaigns designed to steal valuable data from both legacy and cloud-based systems. At the same time, the rapid adoption of cloud applications has increased organizations� attack surface by moving both threats and sensitive data away from the traditional network perimeter, reducing the effectiveness of many existing security products. These factors have contributed to an increasing number of severe data breaches and expanding regulatory mandates, notably the European Union�s General Data Protection Regulation  �GDPR� , all of which have accelerated demand for effective threat protection and compliance solutions.  Our platform addresses this growing challenge by not only protecting data as it flows into and out of the enterprise via on-premises and cloud-based email, social media, and other cloud applications, but also by keeping track of this information as it is modified and distributed throughout the enterprise for compliance and data loss prevention, and securely archiving these communications for compliance and discovery. We help organizations reduce their critical risk in five major ways   �  Protecting users from the advanced attacks that target them via email, web, networks, social media, and cloud apps;  �  Preventing the theft or inadvertent loss of sensitive information and, in turn, ensuring compliance with regulatory data protection mandates;  �  Improving the resilience of end users to the threats that target them and training them to be better caretakers of their organizations� critical data;  �  Collecting, retaining, supervising and discovering communications"}

We believe our ability to combine software and telephony into a single unified platform that is delivered in the cloud creates a significant advantage.  We believe there are two key industry trends driving growth in the cloud contact center market.  First is the rapid increase in adoption of cloud contact center software solutions as a result of several distinct factors. The increasing adoption of cloud computing, especially within customer relationship management, or CRM, is creating strong demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. In addition, cloud contact center software solutions now offer the functionality required by large, complex enterprise contact centers. Furthermore, we believe organizations typically refresh their on-premise contact center systems every eight to 10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud solutions to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems when these replacement decisions arise. On-premise systems require large up-front investments, long deployment cycles, and are burdensome to maintain. These systems are also often inflexible, complex, and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of agents working remotely which presents a challenge to premise-based systems that, by design, are focused on a particular physical location. This creates substantial challenges for clients with on-premise contact center systems. As a result, cloud contact center software solutions are continuing to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems.  Second is digital transformation. Consumers have the ability to easily and quickly switch brands after experiencing poor customer service. Therefore, it is more cr"}

Business  Corporate History and Overview:   SmartMetric, Inc.  �SmartMetric� or the �Company�  is a company that was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002 and is engaged in the biometric technology manufacturing industry. SmartMetric has an issued patent covering technology that involves connection to networks using data cards  smart cards and EMV cards . In addition, SmartMetric holds the sole license to five issued patents covering features of its biometric fingerprint activated cards. SmartMetric�s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card for use in the credit and debit card industry. The SmartMetric fingerprint biometric cards have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation prior to being presented to or inserted in, a credit or debit card reader. These cards are herein sometimes referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.  The Market for Biometric Credit Cards  Estimated Market Size  The estimated size of the market for biometric credit and debit cards is significant. While the company is not making any projections on the actual size of the market a number of industry figures point to the outsized market size and potential.  According to EMVCo which is a credit card standards body responsible for the licensing and rules governing EMV chips used on today�s credit and debit cards, more than 10 billion EMV chip cards have been issued by banks globally.  SmartMetric contracted an independent consumer market research company to ascertain the potential consumer demand for a credit card with incorporated fingerprint biometrics. The survey was conducted in the USA and the respondents were Visa credit card users.  The result of the consumer research survey is as follows.  1  Are you concerned about credit card or identity fraud   Answered Yes  80.1   2  Would you pay for a safer biometric secured credit card that has a built-in fingerprint reader for your protection   Answered Yes  65.5   3  What would you prefer to pay for a biometric fingerprint secured safer credit card   Answer 1   69.95 onetime charge for the life of the card  3 years   60.2   Answer 2   8.95 per month  includes identity theft insurance   39.7   Given these consumer research results and given the number of credit cards issued by banks, it is a massively large potential market that SmartMetric has developed its product for.  All credit and debit cards that are to be issued by a Bank must be tested and approved of by the card brand network that the card is to operate on. Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners brands and networks all have their own individual testing and approval procedures. The card brand that SmartMetric is working with published its biometric testing procedures in March of 2021. This caused the company to make changes to its card.

{"prompt":"", "completion":"Palantir Technologies Inc.:ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview:   We build software platforms for large institutions whose work is essential to our way of life. Those institutions must be able to function in times of stability as well as crisis and uncertainty. To do so, they need software that works.  We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises.  We have built two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham  �Gotham�  and Palantir Foundry  �Foundry� . Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.  We later found that the challenges faced by commercial institutions when it came to working with data were fundamentally similar. An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.  Our software is on the front lines, sometimes literally, and that means so are we. Gotham�s use has now extended beyond intelligence analysis into defense operations and mission planning. And Foundry is becoming the central operating system not only for individual institutions but for entire industries.  The stakes are high. The challenges our platforms address are a matter of survival, both for the institutions we serve and the individuals who depend on them. We have the privilege of partnering with some of the world�s most important government and commercial organizations. And we believe that the work of those organizations is essential to our security and the lives that we lead.  We are committed to ensuring that our software is as effective as possible without ever compromising our values. Our platforms were built from the start to protect individual privacy and prevent the misuse of information. We are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build software platforms that enable our customers to integrate their own data - data that they already have.  The same technology that makes our software so analytically powerful - its ability to construct a model of the real world from countless data points - is what allows our customers to mon"}

Every business, regardless of size, faces a bewildering and burdensome array of constantly shifting transaction tax collection, reporting and remittance obligations imposed by a patchwork of local, regional, state, and national taxing authorities. The rise of omnichannel commerce and international trade has increased this compliance burden. Avalara�s mission is to eliminate this burden and allow companies to focus on their core operations. We offer a leading suite of cloud-based solutions to assist companies with transactional tax and related compliance requirements. This multi-product platform - the Avalara Compliance Cloud - consists of calculation, returns, compliance document management, licensing and registration, tax content, and insight solutions. Our vision is for the Avalara Compliance Cloud to be the leading, category-defining, global cloud compliance platform.  The changes in global economies and technology adoption are generational shifts in favor of Avalara�s compliance automation business. Increases in digital commerce and ongoing adoption of cloud technologies are behavior and productivity shifts that we expect to continue indefinitely. Alongside mounting regulatory change and government adoption of technology for fiscal transparency and efficiency, businesses around the world are looking for efficient, automated processes to mitigate risk and facilitate growth.  Transaction tax rules and regulations change frequently and are neither intuitive nor consistent across taxing jurisdictions, creating a massively complex compliance challenge. Determining the tax due on a particular sale depends not only on the precise geographic location of the transaction within relevant taxing jurisdictions and classifying the product or service into one of thousands of taxation categories, it also can vary based on the date of the transaction because of temporary tax incentives that change the tax rate for specific products, time periods, and transaction thresholds. Further complications to this multi-dimensional challenge arise from duties and taxes assessed on goods crossing national borders, and the thousands of rule changes enacted every year as taxing authorities amend their tax rates and taxability rules, modify jurisdictional boundaries, and implement other regulatory changes.  This complexity is often compounded by the necessity to perform transaction tax determination in real time, at the moment a transaction takes place or an invoice is created, and to determine and collect tax on numerous products or services in multiple jurisdictions. These circumstances are increasingly common with the rise of omnichannel commerce wherein businesses employ multiple channels to conduct sales, ranging from traditional in-store point of sale scenarios to multiple ecommerce platforms to digital marketplaces.

On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of  30,000 in cash. As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,  Raleigh, resigned from all the key executive positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO, CFO and Chairman. The original business model was developed by Mr. Halpern from October 2008 until January 2011, which focused on developing an Internet search engine and social networking web site launched in January of 2010 featuring an outstanding endorsement and web based commercial by William Shatner for stock warrants.

MAX-D is to Audio what High Definition is to Video and today it works by delivering the best-in-class consumer audio experience rivaling any existing product available to listeners globally. Remarkably, MAX-D accomplishes its auditory miracle without increasing file size and saves on bandwidth usage and cost in the process.  In Q2 of 2014, MAXD announced that it had acquired the license and representation rights to VSL�s patented video and data technology known as �Optimized Data Transmission System and Method�  ODT  which enables end-user licensees to transport 100  of data bandwidth content in only 3  of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality.

Business  Overview:   We are the enterprise platform for dynamic work, enabling teams and organizations of all sizes to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale, resulting in more efficient processes and better business outcomes. The nature of work has changed and the majority of work is unstructured or dynamic. The growing volume and variety of information has complicated the process for executing work across teams that are increasingly multidisciplinary and geographically distributed. Unstructured or dynamic work is work that has historically been managed using a combination of email, spreadsheets, whiteboards, phone calls, and in-person meetings to communicate with team members and complete projects and processes. It is frequently changing, often ad-hoc, and highly reactive to new information. Rigid applications, such as ticketing, enterprise resource planning, or customer relationship management systems are poorly suited to manage unstructured work. For nearly 30 years, organizations have primarily relied on lightweight tools to manage dynamic or unstructured work. Reliance on these tools limits visibility and accountability, creates information silos that slow decision-making, and results in delays, errors, and suboptimal outcomes.  Business users need technology solutions they can configure and modify on their own. Today, many systems within an enterprise require IT to implement and manage them. Most tools that focus on the business user require some coding knowledge to incorporate business logic for workflows, integrate data from third-party systems, and adapt to changing business needs.  Smartsheet was founded in 2005 with a vision to build a universal application for work execution that does not require coding capabilities. Our platform serves as a single source of truth across work projects, processes, and initiatives and fosters accountability and engagement within teams, leading to more efficient decision-making and better business outcomes. Our platform provides a number of solutions that eliminate the obstacles to capturing information, including a familiar and intuitive spreadsheet interface as well as easily customizable forms.

Our products and services enable the steps of a job to flow naturally across disparate departments, systems and processes of a business. When work flows naturally, great experiences follow.

In this way, our user-centric approach enables organizations to gain greater control over their procurement, invoicing, payment and other related spend activities, and to manage these processes more efficiently than with traditional, legacy solutions. By de-centralizing BSM workflows and removing unnecessary complexity, our platform reduces an organization�s dependence on its often-backlogged back-office functions, and empowers personnel across the organization to source and purchase goods and services on their own-without sacrificing visibility and control over spending.

Many of today�s enterprise software systems manage their order-to-revenue processes using software built for a product driven economy. These systems were not designed for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services and can be extremely difficult to configure. In traditional product-based businesses, order-to-revenue was a linear process-a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue is recognized. These legacy product-based systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships, commonly found in a subscription business, and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Using product-based software to build a subscription business often results in inefficient processes with prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, and a proliferation of stock-keeping units  SKUs .  However, new subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and analyze data to drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate. That�s where Zuora comes in.  Our vision is �The World Subscribed� -- the idea that one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy. Our focus has been on developing software that enables our customers to thrive as a subscription business.  Our solution includes Zuora Central Platform, Zuora Billing, Zuora Revenue, Zuora Collect, and other software that support and expand upon these core products. Our software helps companies analyze data - including information such as which customers are delivering the most recurring revenue, or which segments are showing the highest churn, enabling customers to make informed decisions for their subscription business and quickly implement changes such as launching new services, updating pricing  usage, time, or outcome based , delivering new o"}

Global organizations use our applications to improve customer experience, achieve operational excellence, and simplify global risk management and compliance.  With our platform, organizations can rapidly and easily design, build, and implement powerful, enterprise-grade custom applications through our intuitive, visual interface with little or no coding required. Our customers have used applications built on our platform to launch new business lines, automate vital employee workflows, manage complex trading platforms, accelerate drug development, and build global procurement systems. With our platform, decision makers can reimagine their products, services, processes, and customer interactions by removing much of the complexity and many of the challenges associated with traditional approaches to software development.  Organizations across all industries are digitally transforming by leveraging software to automate and optimize mission critical operations, enhance customer experiences, and drive competitive differentiation. Historically, organizations have principally relied on packaged software and custom software solutions to operationalize and automate their businesses. Packaged software often fails to address unusual use cases or to enable differentiation and requires organizations to adapt their individual processes, needs, and systems of record to standardized frameworks. While traditional custom software solutions can be differentiated and tailored to meet strategic objectives, development requires a long, iterative, and cumbersome process, as well as costly integration, and relies on scarce developer talent.  We enable organizations to differentiate themselves from their competition through software-enabled digital transformation. Our low-code automation platform employs an intuitive, visual interface and pre-built development modules that reduce the time required to build powerful and unique applications. Our platform automates the creation of forms, workflows, data structures, reports, and other software elements that would otherwise need to be manually coded. This functionality greatly reduces the iterative development process, allowing for real-time optimization and ultimately shortening the time it takes to design, build, and deploy applications.

Our robust platform enables developers to build and modernize applications rapidly and cost-effectively across a broad range of use cases. Organizations can deploy our platform at scale in the cloud, on-premise, or in a hybrid environment. Through our unique document-based architecture, we are able to address the needs of organizations for performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability while maintaining the strengths of legacy databases. Our business model combines the developer mindshare and adoption benefits of open source with the economic benefits of a proprietary software subscription business model.  Software applications are redefining how organizations across industries engage with their customers, operate their businesses and compete with each other. To compete effectively in today�s global, data-driven market environment, organizations must provide their end-users with applications that capture and leverage the vast volumes and varieties of available data. As a result, the software developers who build and maintain these applications are increasingly influential in organizations and demand for their talent has grown substantially. Consequently, organizations of all sizes and industries and across geographies have significantly increased investment in developers with the strategic goal of improving the organization�s pace of innovation and competitive position.  A database is at the heart of every software application. Every software application requires a database to store, organize and process data. Large organizations can have tens of thousands of applications and associated databases. A database directly impacts an application's performance, scalability, flexibility and reliability. As a result, selecting a database  is a highly strategic decision that directly affects developer productivity, application performance and organizational competitiveness.  Legacy relational databases were first developed in the 1970s and their underlying architecture remains largely unchanged even though the nature of applications, how they are deployed and their role in business have evolved dramatically. Modern software development is highly iterative and requires flexibility. Relational databases were not built to support the volume, variety and velocity of data being generated today, hindering application performance and developer productivity. In a relational database environment, developers are often required to spend significant time fixing and maintaining the linkages between modern applications and the rigid database structures that are inherent in relational offerings. Further, relational databases were built before cloud computing was popularized and were not designed for �always-on� globally distributed deployments. These factors have left developers and their organizations in need of more agile and effective database alternatives. A number of non-r"}

Twilio was started to solve this problem in 2008.  Twilio spent the last 12 years building the leading cloud communication platform, but communications is just the beginning. Twilio's vision is to be the leading customer engagement platform, ultimately providing businesses with the holy grail-a single view of the customer journey. We believe the future of customer engagement will be written in software, by the developers of the world-our customers.  Cloud platforms are a category of software that enable developers to build and manage applications without the complexity of creating and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. These platforms have arisen to enable a fast pace of innovation across a range of categories, such as computing and storage. We are the leader in the cloud communications platform category. We enable developers to build, scale and operate real-time customer engagement within software applications.  We offer a customer engagement platform with software designed to address specific use cases, like account security and contact centers, and a set of Application Programming Interfaces   APIs   that handles the higher-level communication logic needed for nearly every type of customer engagement. These APIs are focused on the business challenges that a developer is looking to address, allowing our customers to more quickly and easily build better ways to engage with their customers throughout their journey. We also offer a set of APIs that enable developers to embed voice, messaging, video and email capabilities into their applications, and are designed to support almost all the fundamental ways humans communicate, unlocking innovators to address just about any communication market.

New Relic One is our purpose-built offering for customers to land all of their telemetry data quickly and affordably in one place, and to translate that data into actionable insights. We believe a truly unified front-end that sits on top of a single database helps our users avoid complexity and confusion that would be associated with relying instead upon multiple different but related products.  With our re-launch of the New Relic One platform in July 2020, we transitioned from a collection of related but disparate products, to a broader, more comprehensive observability platform. From a business perspective, we made two significant changes to our model. First, we reduced our number of SKUs from thirteen unique offerings to a cohesive platform supported by three products. We believe this simplification represents tremendous value to our customers who share our vision for observability and see the value of one unified front-end on top of a single database. Second, we also changed our pricing model from upfront subscriptions to a consumption-based pricing model and adjusted our go-to-market motion to drive consumption. Customers only pay us for what they use and our sales team�s interests are better aligned with the interests of the customer.  We now believe our New Relic One platform is positioned as the only true observability platform, which is grounded in three strategic technological pillars   1.We serve all engineers  New Relic One is used not just by IT operations professionals but by a wide variety of engineers, including application developers, mobile developers, site reliability engineers  �SRE� , network engineers and more.

Over the past decade, we�ve largely accomplished that mission by building tools to help people work from anywhere-and along the way we recognized that for most of our users, sharing and collaborating on Dropbox was even more valuable than storing files.  Our market opportunity has grown as we�ve expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. Today, Dropbox is well-positioned to reimagine the way work gets done. We're focusing on reducing the inordinate amount of time and energy the world spends on �work about work�-tedious tasks like searching for content, switching between applications, and managing workflows. We believe the need for our platform will continue to grow as teams become more fluid and global, and content is increasingly fragmented across incompatible tools and devices. Dropbox breaks down silos by centralizing the flow of information between the products and services our users prefer, even if they�re not our own. In a world where using technology at work can be fragmented and distracting, Dropbox makes it easy to focus on the work that matters.  The popularity of our platform drives viral growth, which has allowed us to scale rapidly and efficiently. We�ve built a thriving global business with 15.48 million paying users.  What Sets Us Apart  Since the beginning, we�ve focused on simplifying the lives of our users.

As businesses around the world adapt to a distributed environment, Dropbox is at the forefront of developing the technology to support them. Dropbox provides tools to help distributed teams prioritize, get organized, and keep work moving securely-from anywhere.

In recent years, the technology industry has undergone a massive transition from on-premise hardware and software that customers buy, to services in the cloud that they rent. Organizations find themselves at different points in this transition to the cloud. Regardless of where organizations are in their transition, they all face a common set of challenges  they exist in a complex, heterogeneous infrastructure environment which exacerbates the fundamental problems of the Internet more than ever, and the on-premise hardware boxes that they once relied upon to solve these problems were never designed to work in such an environment. As more workloads move to the cloud, there is no point in installing additional hardware boxes on premise. An on-premise box will not solve the problems organizations now face. Nor can a business ship a hardware box to a cloud vendor. Even if they wanted to, there is literally no place to install such a box in the cloud.  The result is that a major architectural shift at the network layer is now underway. Previously, enterprises would often string together a diverse set of on-premise hardware boxes from different vendors to solve their network challenges. As these solutions move to the cloud, the network latency, support complexity, and cost of overhead makes stringing together multiple point-cloud solutions that only address a specific network need untenable. Customers are therefore looking to consolidate behind a single global cloud services provider.  Cloudflare is a global cloud services provider that delivers a broad range of services to businesses of all sizes and in all geographies-making them more secure, enhancing the performance of their business-critical applications, and eliminating the cost and complexity of managing individual network hardware. Our network serves as a scalable, easy-to-use, unified control plane to deliver security, performance, and reliability across on-premise, hybrid, cloud, and software-as-a-service  SaaS  applications. We serve comprehensive customer needs across security, performance, and reliability. As of December 31, 2020, more than 17  of the Fortune 1,000 were paying Cloudflare customers.

Our platform adds structure to unstructured work, creating clarity, transparency, and accountability to everyone within an organization-individuals, team leads, and executives-so they understand exactly who is doing what, by when.  History  We started Asana because our co-founders experienced firsthand the growing problem of work about work. While at Facebook, they saw the coordination challenges the company faced as it scaled. Instead of spending time on work that generated results, they were spending time in status meetings and long email threads trying to figure out who was responsible for what. They recognized the pain of work about work was universal to teams that need to coordinate their work effectively to achieve their objectives. Yet there were no products in the market that adequately addressed this pain. As a result of that frustration, they were inspired to create Asana to solve this problem for the world�s teams.  Since our inception, over 30 million users have registered on Asana and millions of teams in virtually every country around the world have used Asana. With Asana, users experience higher productivity, which has led to rapid adoption across teams, departments, and organizations. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 1.5 million paid users.  Teams Spend Too Much Time on Work About Work  Work continues to get harder to manage as organizations try to move faster to accomplish ambitious goals and respond to changing market demands. Today, 60  of knowledge workers� time is spent on work about work. Moreover, coordinating work within and across teams is chaotic. Without a system of record, teams move slowly, miss deadlines, and fail to live up to their full potential. At work, people face an overwhelming volume of communications from email and messaging applications, many of which are asking for status updates. These messages often provide limited clarity around what steps need to be taken, and by when, and limited accountability around who owns the action. As a result, requests go unanswered, and employees spend more time searching and responding to messages in an attempt to provide clarity and accountability to their teams. These emails and messages only give teams momentary clarity about specific deliverables or actions, and as such they do not provide a holistic, persistent, and referenceable plan of record that can be easily or quickly accessed.  To minimize work about work, reduce chaos, and give individuals time back to focus on the work that matters, teams need a purpose-built solution for coordination.

Through Domo�s Business Cloud, data from across the business is collected, stored, prepared, organized, analyzed, visualized, and shared. Algorithms and machine learning can be applied to the data that allow alerts to be triggered and actions invited. Users can receive these notifications on any device and immediately act on the invitation, after which the system can write back to the original system of record. Because Domo can digitally connect any organization and empower each of its employees, we believe our market potential is every working person with a mobile device. Because we leverage the power of the cloud, our platform can process extremely large volumes of quantitative and qualitative data while maintaining high performance levels. On a typical business day, our customers in the aggregate typically query several hundred trillion rows from uncached queries. Even with this volume of data, we maintain a subsecond average query response time. In aggregate, the data in Domo can be indexed anonymously.

{"prompt":"", "completion":"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.:Item 1. Business  Overview:   We founded CrowdStrike in 2011 to reinvent security for the cloud era. When we started the company, cyberattackers had a decided, asymmetric advantage over existing security products. We turned the tables on the adversaries by taking a fundamentally new approach that leverages the network effects of crowdsourced data applied to modern technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and graph databases. Realizing that the nature of cybersecurity problems had changed but the solutions had not, we built our CrowdStrike Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches.  We believe we are defining a new category called the Security Cloud, with the power to transform the security industry much the same way the cloud has transformed the customer relationship management, human resources, and service management industries. With our Falcon platform, we created the first multi-tenant, cloud native, intelligent security solution capable of protecting workloads across on-premise, virtualized, and cloud-based environments running on a variety of endpoints such as desktops, laptops, servers, virtual machines, cloud workloads, cloud containers, mobile, and IoT devices. Our Falcon platform is composed of two tightly integrated proprietary technologies  our easily deployed intelligent lightweight agent and our cloud-based, dynamic graph database called Threat Graph. Our solution benefits from crowdsourcing and economies of scale, which we believe enables our AI algorithms to be uniquely effective. We call this cloud-scale AI. Our single lightweight agent is installed on each endpoint or the cloud workload and provides local detection and prevention capabilities while also intelligently collecting and streaming high fidelity data to our platform for real-time decision-making. Our Threat Graph processes, correlates, and analyzes this data in the cloud using a combination of AI and behavioral pattern-matching techniques. By analyzing and correlating information across our massive, crowdsourced dataset, we are able to deploy our AI algorithms at cloud-scale and build a more intelligent, effective solution to detect threats and stop breaches that on-premise or single instance cloud products cannot match. Today, we offer 19 cloud modules and our Falcon platform via a SaaS subscription-based model that spans multiple large markets, including corporate workload security, security and vulnerability management, managed security services, IT operations management, threat intelligence services, identity protection and log management.  Organizations everywhere are becoming more distributed as they adopt the cloud, increase workforce mobility, and grow their number of connected devices.

Our solutions simplify the complex, allowing security teams to work more effectively with IT and development to reduce vulnerabilities, monitor for misconfigurations and malicious behavior, investigate and shut down attacks, and automate routine tasks.  In the 20 years that Rapid7 has been in business, security companies and trends have come and gone, while broader technology innovation continues to advance rapidly. Every company is now a technology company, and rampant innovation inevitably creates security risk. The migration of businesses to the cloud, more distributed workforces and ubiquitous connected devices present security teams with an increasingly complex, ever-changing, and unpredictable attack surface.  We believe as cybersecurity challenges continue to rise exponentially, two key factors can prevent organizations from effectively managing their growing security exposure. First, the tools to manage complex security problems are often equally complicated to use. Second, there is a scarcity of cybersecurity professionals who are qualified to successfully manage these sophisticated tools. These two factors compound the difficulties that resource-constrained organizations face when attempting to minimize their security exposure, meet security compliance regulations and provide visibility to their leadership. We call the expanding divide between risk created through innovation and risk effectively managed by security teams the Security Achievement Gap.  We believe Rapid7 is uniquely positioned to improve how customer security challenges are addressed. All of our solutions and services are built with and supported by the expertise of our dedicated team of security researchers and consultants, who bring knowledge of attacker behavior and emerging vulnerabilities directly to customers. We also continue to invest in further simplifying our technology to improve usability, lowering the barrier for teams and organizations who lack resources to manage their security posture.  While our security technology is the foundation of our mission to make successful security accessible to all, technology alone will not solve today�s cybersecurity challenges.

Software applications are transforming how organizations engage with customers and operate their businesses. Companies across all industries are re-platforming their businesses to cloud infrastructures to enable this digital transformation. Historically, engineering teams have been siloed, making the development of next generation applications on dynamic cloud environments challenging.

Since then we have continuously pushed to unify separate tools into an integrated monitoring and analytics platform, readily available to everyone who cares about applications and their impact on business.  From our founding goal of breaking down silos between Dev and Ops, we set out in 2010 to build a real-time data integration platform to turn chaos from disparate sources into digestible and actionable insights. In 2012, we launched our first use case with infrastructure monitoring, purpose-built to handle increasingly ephemeral cloud-native architectures. This enabled us to be deployed on our customers� entire cloud IT environments and gave our product broad usage across Dev, Ops and business teams, in turn allowing us to address a bigger set of challenges through our platform.

Some of these challenges relate to how a business effectively manages secure application services across various data centers and cloud types - whether private, public or hybrid clouds. Over time, more and more applications may be born in the cloud, while some applications that existed in traditional data centers may migrate to clouds as well. To address this shift, businesses will need solutions that bridge both traditional and cloud-based application environments and centrally manage all secure application services holistically in this multi-cloud world.

Our solution requires virtually no customization and is based on a core system of record maintained in a single database for all HCM functions, including talent acquisition, time and labor management, payroll, talent management and human resources  �HR�  management applications. Our user-friendly software allows for easy adoption of our solution by employees, enabling self-management of their HCM activities in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on employers and increases employee productivity.  We were founded in 1998 and became a publicly traded company through our initial public offering in 2014. Since our founding, we have focused on providing an innovative SaaS HCM solution. Organizations need sophisticated, flexible and intuitive applications that can quickly adapt to their evolving HCM requirements, streamline their HR processes and systems and enable them to control costs. We believe the HCM needs of most organizations are currently served either by multiple providers in an attempt to replicate a comprehensive SaaS product or, to a lesser extent, by legacy providers offering outdated on-premise products. These approaches often result in challenges with system integration and data integrity, low scalability, high costs, extended delivery times and large up-front capital requirements.  Because our solution was developed in-house and is based on a single platform, there is no need to integrate, update or access multiple databases, which are common issues with competitor offerings that use multiple third-party systems in order to link together their HCM offerings. Additionally, our solution maintains data integrity for accurate, actionable and real-time analytics and business intelligence and helps clients minimize the risks of compliance errors due to inaccurate or missing information. We deliver feature-rich applications while maintaining excellence in information security and quality management standards, as evidenced by our International Organization for Standardization  �ISO�  certifications.  We sell our solution directly through our internally trained, client-focused and highly skilled sales force based in offices across the United States. As a part of our client retention effort, a specialist within a dedicated team is assigned to each client to provide industry-leading, personalized service. We have approximately 31,000 clients, none of which constituted more than one-half of one percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that as a result of our focus on client experience, we enjoy high client satisfaction as evidenced by an annual revenue retention rate of 93 , 93  and 92  from existi"}

Yext  or the  Company   organizes a business's facts so it can provide official answers to consumer questions starting with the business's own website and then extending across search engines and voice assistants. Our platform lets businesses structure the facts about their brands in a database called the Knowledge Graph. Our platform is built to leverage the structured data stored in the Knowledge Graph to deliver a modern search experience on a business�s or organization's own website, as well as across approximately 200 service and application providers, which we refer to as our Knowledge Network, and includes Amazon Alexa, Apple Maps, Bing, Cortana, Facebook, Google, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Siri and Yelp. Our platform powers all of our key features, including Listings, Pages, and Answers, along with its other features and capabilities. We believe a business is the ultimate authority on its own facts, and it is our mission to put that business in control of it, everywhere.  The online consumer journey is changing. With the introduction of natural language processing and the growing prevalence of voice assistants and chatbots, search has become more conversational. Consumers are no longer just typing in individual keywords like �mortgage� or �menswear,� but are also using natural language phrases like �wealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare� and even asking specific, complex questions like �what�s the best menswear store in London that sells dress shirts and is open now � Web and mobile applications and voice and artificial intelligence, or AI, engines are increasingly answering questions directly and in certain cases providing only one answer unlike traditional web-based search where many results are displayed as a list requiring further exploration. As search continues to evolve, and increasingly leverages AI, consumers are more likely to rely on these direct answers.  While consumer online search behavior has changed, the site search experience on many businesses� websites has not evolved to meet consumer expectations. Numerous site searches are unable to understand natural language queries instead returning a list of links based on keywords rather than direct answers. Poor user experience on a business�s own website may result in lost sales opportunities or may cause consumers to visit a competitor�s website. The challenge for businesses is to understand and provide accurate answers to consumer�s questions while delivering a rich, consistent search experience on their website as well as third-party applications. Many answers and results provided by searches currently come from third-party sources such as data aggregators, governmental agencies and consumers. The net result of this third-party sourcing has been to produce �best guess� data that can often be incomplete, misleading or incorrect.

We are driven by the belief that AI is key to building a safer, more vibrant, transparent and empowered society. Our mission is to be an active contributor to making the world better through AI.  Today, over 80  of new data created worldwide is unstructured, which is increasing at an annual growth rate of 30-60  per year, according to Gartner  2020 Strategic Roadmap for Storage, July 1, 2020 . This creates significant challenges for companies and governments across the globe - specifically, how to create systematic solutions to address the ever-increasing volume of unstructured data. Whether it is a local police department trying to rapidly solve crimes through analysis of video evidence, a media company searching years of television archives for specific images and video content, or the U.S. military trying to analyze huge volumes of satellite and other aerial images, we believe AI is the only efficient solution to these complex challenges.  To address the ever-growing challenges surrounding unstructured data, we developed aiWARE�, our proprietary AI operating system. aiWARE orchestrates machine learning algorithms, or AI models, together with a suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. Our multi-faceted aiWARE platform offers capabilities that mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction, problem solving and optimization, enabling users to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data, and analyze and optimize data to drive business processes and insights.  aiWARE is based on an open architecture that enables new AI models, applications and workflows to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a future proof, scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged by organizations in a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data, together with structured data, such as the media and entertainment, government, legal and compliance, energy and other vertical markets, driving down the cost, complexity and time to develop, deploy and distribute AI-enabled applications in their operations. Our aiWARE platform is offered primarily through a software-as-a-service  �SaaS�  delivery model and can be deployed in a number of environments and configurations to meet customers� needs.  We believe the opportunity to create a sustainable and growing business around AI and AI-enabled solutions is large and growing significantly. According to Omdia  Artificial Intelligence Software Market Forecast, 2020 , the AI market today is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate  CAGR  of 35 , to reach  100.0 billion in 2025.

Our solutions run across private-, hybrid- and multicloud environments, and allow organizations to seamlessly  lift and shift  their workloads, including enterprise applications, high-performance databases, end-user computing and virtual desktop infrastructure   VDI   services, cloud native workloads, and analytics applications, between different cloud environments. Our goal is to provide a single, simple, open software platform for all hybrid and multicloud applications and data.  Founded in 2009, we pioneered the hyperconverged infrastructure   HCI   category, initially combining the disparate IT silos of compute, storage and networking into a single on-premises product which offered total cost of ownership, scalability and customer choice. We continued to innovate and developed Acropolis Hypervisor   AHV   - our native hypervisor designed to run all virtualized applications. To give our customers even more choice, we engineered our software solutions to run on a variety of server platforms, decoupling our software from our Nutanix-branded hardware appliances and powering a variety of on-premises private cloud deployments; a significant step in our transition from a hardware to a software company. That transition has continued with the adoption of  cloud  as a mainstream IT paradigm, which has motivated IT professionals to move toward hybrid cloud architectures that allow businesses to simultaneously utilize a private cloud powered by Nutanix software, along with third-party public cloud infrastructures for maximum flexibility. We continue to transform our software solutions into a comprehensive enterprise cloud platform, based on web-scale engineering principles and with a focus on operational simplicity, which allows our customers to power nearly any scale IT deployment. Although today our customers primarily use our enterprise cloud platform to power their on-premises private cloud deployments, our solutions also simplify the complexities of multicloud environments with a single management console for automation, cost governance and compliance. The end result will be an enterprise cloud platform that empowers our customers to unify various clouds - on-premises private, public and distributed - into one seamless cloud, allowing IT to choose the right cloud for each application.  To provide our customers with the freedom to choose the best consumption model based on their specific business needs, we have also continued to reshape our licensing by moving toward a subscription-based business model.

SailPoint was launched by a team of visionary industry veterans to empower our customers to efficiently and securely govern the digital identities of employees, contractors, business partners, software bots and other human and non-human users, and manage their constantly changing access rights to enterprise applications and data. Our identity security solutions provide organizations with critical visibility into who currently has access to which resources, who should have access to those resources and how that access is being used. We offer both software as a service  �SaaS�  and software solutions, which provide organizations the intelligence required to empower users and govern their access to systems, applications and data across hybrid IT environments, spanning on-premises and cloud applications and file storage platforms. We help customers enable their businesses with more agile and innovative IT, streamline delivery of access to their businesses, enhance their security posture and better meet compliance and regulatory requirements. Our customers include many of the world�s largest and most complex organizations, including commercial enterprises, financial institutions and governments.  Organizations globally are investing in technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence   AI   and machine learning   ML   to improve employee productivity, business agility and competitiveness. Today, enterprise environments are more open and interconnected with their business partners, contractors, vendors and customers. Business users have driven a dramatic increase in the number of applications and amount of data that organizations need to manage, much of which sits beyond the traditional network perimeter. Because of these trends, the attack surface is expanding while well-funded cyber attackers, in some cases sponsored by nation-states, have significantly increased the frequency and sophistication of their attacks. For example, it has been reported that the SolarWinds breach was part of a highly sophisticated, broad and coordinated nation-state cyber operation that targeted the IT infrastructure of the United States and potentially other countries as well. As a result, IT professionals need to manage and secure increasingly complex hybrid IT environments within these extended enterprises.  Attackers frequently target the identity vector as it allows them to leverage user identities to gain access to high-value systems and data while concealing their activity and movements within an organization�s IT infrastructure. The consequences of a data breach can be extremely damaging, with organizations facing significant costs to remediate the breach and repair brand and reputational damage.

To realize this vision, we deliver the Data Cloud, an ecosystem where Snowflake customers, partners, data providers, and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways.  Our platform is the innovative technology that powers the Data Cloud, enabling customers to consolidate data into a single source of truth to drive meaningful business insights, build data-driven applications, and share data. We provide our platform through a customer-centric, consumption-based business model, only charging customers for the resources they use.  Snowflake solves the decades-old problem of data silos and data governance. Leveraging the elasticity and performance of the public cloud, our platform enables customers to unify and query data to support a wide variety of use cases. It also provides frictionless and governed data access so users can securely share data inside and outside of their organizations, generally without copying or moving the underlying data. As a result, customers can blend existing data with new data for broader context, augment data science efforts, and create new monetization streams. Delivered as a service, our platform requires near-zero maintenance, enabling customers to focus on deriving value from their data rather than managing infrastructure.  Our cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable layers across storage, compute, and cloud services. The storage layer ingests massive amounts and varieties of structured and semi-structured data to create a unified data record. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases without latency. The cloud services layer intelligently optimizes each use case�s performance requirements with no administration. This architecture is built on three major public clouds across 23 regional deployments around the world. These deployments are interconnected to deliver the Data Cloud, enabling a consistent, global user experience.  Our platform supports a wide range of use cases that enable our customers� most important business objectives, including data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, data science, data application development, and data sharing.

Cyber Exposure is a discipline for managing, measuring and comparing cybersecurity risk in the digital era.  Digital transformation is driving radical change and is powering the economy and our social infrastructure. A digital-first economy is only sustainable if it is built with a solid cybersecurity foundation. As organizations modernize their IT infrastructures and adopt cloud or hybrid cloud architectures that are no longer housed in the confines of their corporate networks, they have less visibility and control over the security of these assets. Organizations are also increasingly implementing modern solutions, such as Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, web applications and application containers, to enable the rapid development and deployment of new products, services and business models, as well as to drive operational efficiencies. Further, safety-critical Operational Technology, or OT, such as Industrial Control Systems, are now network-connected and must be secured from cybersecurity threats.  While other functions in an organization, such as finance and operations, have a system to help them manage and measure risk, cybersecurity risk has not historically been adequately measured or understood. Our enterprise platform provides a unified view into the organization�s state of security, enables security teams to prioritize and focus their remediation efforts, and translates vulnerability data into actionable business metrics and insights that boards of directors and executives can understand and use to make strategic decisions. We believe our Cyber Exposure solutions are transforming how cybersecurity risk is managed and measured and will help organizations more rapidly embrace digital transformation.  Our platform offerings provide broad visibility into security issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, internal and regulatory compliance violations and other indicators of the state of an organization�s security across IT infrastructure and applications, cloud environments and Industrial IoT and OT environments. We also provide deep analytics to help organizations score, trend and compare their cyber exposure over time, and communicate cyber risk in business terms to make better strategic decisions.

Also on December 26, 2018, STLR Merger Subsidiary Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stellar  �Merger Sub� , merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger  the �Merger�  and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Successor  the �Business Combination� . Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Company  which became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Successor , changed its corporate name to �Phunware OpCo, Inc.� As of the open of trading on December 28, 2018, the common stock and warrants of the registrant began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market as �PHUN� and �PHUNW,� respectively.  There was no accounting effect or change in the carrying amount of the consolidated assets and liabilities as a result of the Domestication. The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles   GAAP   in the United States. Accordingly, Stellar is the legal acquirer and Phunware is the accounting acquirer and predecessor. As such, our historical financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Phunware. Inc., and the cash proceeds of  0.4 million  less transaction costs paid at closing  obtained from Stellar in the Business Combination is reflected as a capital infusion. Furthermore, the historical capitalization of Phunware, Inc, immediately before the Business Combination was adjusted based on the exchange ratio of 0.459 Successor shares for every one share of Phunware, Inc. capital stock.

{"prompt":"", "completion":"BLACKLINE, INC.:Item 1. Business  Overview:   We have created comprehensive cloud-based solutions designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes. Our secure, scalable solutions support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, cash application, intercompany accounting, and compliance. By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations.  Critical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization�s financial reports. The lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. Traditional enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization�s general ledger, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close process. Many organizations also use multiple ERPs and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them. As a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes that are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses. We believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional ERP  systems. We believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process management and staff productivity, in addition to managing a faster financial close.  Our mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate. Our approach modernizes what historically has been done through batch processing and manual controls typically applied only during the month, quarter or year-end financial close, and delivers dynamic workflows embedded within a real-time, highly automated framework, a process we refer to as �continuous accounting.� It also enables up-to-date analytics, provides industry-benchmarked metrics and is designed to help customers run more efficiently while achieving greater accuracy, control and transparency. We believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements. Our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than 30 different ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday, as well as many other financial system"}

Our platform�s integrations with major inventory, publisher, and data partners provides ad buyers reach and decisioning capabilities, and our enterprise application programming interfaces  �APIs�  enable our clients to develop on top of the platform.  We commercially launched our platform in 2011, targeting the display advertising channel. Since launching, we have added additional advertising channels. In 2020, the gross spend on our platform came from multiple channels including mobile, video  which includes CTV , display, audio, native and social channels.

As digital media grows, audience fragmentation is accelerating. A growing �long tail� of mobile applications  apps , media players, websites and content presents a challenge for advertisers trying to reach a large audience.

With the Alteryx APA software platform, users can automate the full range of analytics, data science and processes, embed intelligent decision-making and actions, and empower their organization to enable top and bottom line impact, efficiency gains, and rapid upskilling.  Leveraging data for actionable insights is critical to modern business success, but has become increasingly challenging as the volume, velocity, and variety of data continues to expand. Traditional data analysis tools and processes are slow, complex, difficult to use, and resource-intensive, often requiring multiple steps by data analysts, data scientists, data engineers, information technology, or IT, employees, and other data workers to complete even the most basic analysis. As a result, these point tools and processes are unable to keep pace with the sophistication and speed of analytics demanded by organizations today.  Our platform democratizes access to data-driven insights by expanding the capabilities and analytical sophistication available to all analytic producers, ranging from business analysts to expert programmers and trained data scientists. We unify the analytics and analytic process into one simple self-service experience by combining tasks that were previously distributed among multiple tools and parties. Our platform allows a single user or group of users to easily and quickly discover, access, and prepare data from a multitude of sources, perform a variety of analyses, and deliver analytical output to drive data-driven decisions and improve business outcomes. This is done through a no-code, low-code approach and visual workflows and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can reduce tedious, time-consuming manual tasks to a few mouse-clicks while eliminating the need to write complex software code.

We predicted that with rapid cloud adoption and increasing workforce mobility, traditional perimeter security approaches would provide inadequate protection for users and data and an increasingly poor user experience. We pioneered a cloud platform, the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, that represents a fundamental shift in the architectural design and approach to networking and security.

Datto Holding ,  Datto , �we,� �us,� �our� and �the Company�  is the leading provider of cloud-based software and technology solutions purpose-built for delivery through the MSP channel to SMBs. MSPs represent the future of information technology   IT   management for SMBs. Digital transformation is driving SMB adoption of modern software and technology, while regulatory and data protection requirements and proliferating security threats are increasing the complexity and risk of IT for SMBs. These trends have created an inflection point in SMB outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, serving as a single provider to meet all of an SMB�s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure, implement and manage software and technology stacks that support their SMB customers� business needs. The number of MSPs continues to grow, with approximately 125,000 MSPs providing this critical function to millions of SMBs worldwide today.  We are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. Our MSP-centric platform enables our partners to generate recurring revenue through the sale of our solutions to SMBs and to scale and effectively manage their own businesses. Our relationships are directly with our MSP partners. We are the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, and believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating as it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and reinforces our position as an integral component of our MSP partners� businesses.  Our cloud-based offerings include Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management software solutions. Our Unified Continuity and Networking offerings ensure the ongoing availability and security of mission-critical IT systems for SMBs on-premise, in private clouds and in the public cloud. These solutions are simple for MSPs to deploy, configure and manage across their SMB customers through a single portal. Our Business Management software provides critical operational tools to MSPs for efficient workflow management and delivery of end-to-end managed services.

SurveyMonkey�s products enable more than 345,000 organizations to deliver better customer experiences, increase employee retention, and unlock growth and innovation.  We are continuing our rapid evolution from a self-serve online survey tool provider into an enterprise Software-as-a-Service  �SaaS�  company. Through a combination of product innovations and acquisitions, we now offer SaaS feedback solutions across three major product pillars-Surveys, Customer Experience, and Market Research. Concurrently, we are building a sales force to increase new sales and cross-sell our SaaS offerings into small, midsize, and large enterprises. In 2020, approximately 29  of our total revenue was generated from customers who purchased software through our enterprise sales force, up from 21  in 2019.

{"prompt":"", "completion":"Slack Technologies, Inc.:ITEM 1. BUSINESS  Overview:   Slack is the leading channels-based messaging platform, used by millions to align their teams, unify their systems, and drive their businesses forward. Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack is where work happens.  The most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. Like email  or the Internet or electricity , Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks.  Unlike email, however, most of this activity happens in team-based channels, rather than in individual inboxes. Channels offer a persistent record of the conversations, data, documents, and application workflows relevant to a project or a topic. Membership of a channel can change over time as people join or leave a project or organization, and users benefit from the accumulated historical information in a way an employee never could when starting with an empty email inbox. Depending on the size of the organization, this might provide tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times more access to information than is available to individuals working in environments where email is the primary means of communication. Slack also enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts, and the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack.  Also unlike email, Slack was designed from the ground up to integrate with external software systems. Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Further, Slack�s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization�s internally-developed software. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the three months ended January 31, 2021. In 2019, we introduced Workflow Builder, a low-code solution to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface.

{"prompt":"", "completion":"JFrog Ltd:Item 1. Business  Overview:   JFrog�s vision is to power a world of continuously updated, version-less software-we call this Liquid Software.  We provide an end-to-end, hybrid, universal DevOps Platform to achieve Continuous Software Release Management, or CSRM. Our leading CSRM platform enables organizations to continuously deliver software updates across any system. Our platform is the critical bridge between software development and deployment of that software, paving the way for the modern DevOps paradigm. We enable organizations to build and release software faster and more securely while empowering developers to be more efficient. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 6,050 organizations have adopted JFrog, embarking on their journey towards Liquid Software.  Digital transformation has become an imperative for all organizations, and as such, organizations of all types and sizes are increasingly dependent upon software to better engage with their customers, partners, and employees. As a result, the continuous and reliable release of new software has become mission critical. An organization�s failure to keep software current or react to problems with timely software updates can not only cost lost revenue and reputation, but also threaten human safety and lives. The increased pace and volume of new software and updates have made releasing software in monolithic, discrete versions  e.g., v1.0, v2.0, v3.0  too slow to adequately address dynamic customer demands. We believe the end state of digital transformation is a non-stop, always-on, secure, continuous delivery of value to users, enabled by a world of version-less software.  DevOps enables the software innovation that is driving digital transformation. The need for organizations to better serve their customers, partners, and employees through software is driving the demand for constant innovation of the software build and release workflow. As the pace and variety of software creation have increased, the domains of software �developers� and IT �operators� have converged. Since our inception, we have embraced the culture and methodologies of modern software development and delivered a platform that connects developers and operators, thus providing the foundation for DevOps. DevOps has since become the approach modern digital organizations take to software development and operations, shortening, automating, and improving the software build and release workflow.  While many software development technologies today address aspects of a particular segment of DevOps, CSRM, enabled by JFrog, provides the common ground for software developers and IT operators, making it integral to the DevOps workflow. Software as it is written by a developer, in source code, cannot be deployed in a runtime environment. In order for software to run in production, source code is transformed into executable binary files that can be understood by and run on a server or device. Organizations need tools that can turn source code "}

We believe the world is a better place with more creators in it. Creators, ranging from game developers to artists, architects, automotive designers, filmmakers, and others, use Unity to make their imaginations come to life.  Our platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had, on average, approximately 2.7 billion monthly active end users who consumed content created or operated with our solutions. The applications developed by these creators were downloaded, on average, five billion times per month in 2020.  Content built on the Unity platform offers end-users a fundamentally more engaging and immersive experience than traditional static content. Content made with Unity is interactive, allowing end-users to connect with the content and with one another. Content made with Unity is real-time, allowing it to instantly adapt to end-user behavior and feedback. Content made with Unity allows graphics to be expressed with 3D shape and depth, permitting multiple viewing angles, and enabling augmented and virtual reality.  Real-time is not just a part of the end-user experience. Building content on Unity offers creators significant advantages in development compared to traditional content creation tools. Creators can visualize and iterate on their 2D and 3D creations in real-time and collaborate with each other to edit content simultaneously. This can lead to significant reductions in design and development cycle times. The demand for interactive, real-time 3D content is expanding rapidly. Compute processors have become dramatically faster and more powerful. Improvements in bandwidth have enabled smartphones, PCs, consoles and other devices to connect at a global scale. Cloud computing has removed the limitations on processing power and storage to support content. These factors are driving significant increases in available compute power and are enabling the spread of immersive and interactive content. As a result, creators can now develop more intricate, higher fidelity experiences for end-users to enjoy on more devices and across larger connected communities. The gaming industry has benefited enormously from these enabling technologies with over 2.6 billion gamers driving the fastest growing sector in media today.  Unity has built its reputation in gaming, and our scale and reach in this industry are significant. We estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2020, 71  of the top 1,000 mobile games were made with Unity.

In doing so, we help companies to find answers to their toughest business challenges. All efforts we perform are in support of our purpose of transforming how businesses work and people live through the power of data.  Teradata has broadened its market opportunity by evolving from an on-premises only, enterprise data warehouse company to a multi-cloud, enterprise data warehouse platform provider. We help our customers integrate and simplify their data and analytics ecosystem, streamline access and management of data, and use analytics to derive business value from diverse data types. Our target market focuses on organizations that are the world's most demanding, large-scale users of data.  The largest companies in the world have spent decades building mission-critical, complex, and large-scale on-premises data environments. However, these companies face significant challenges from ecosystems that have grown over time, including siloed data and conflicting and duplicative solutions, resulting in environments that are highly complex and expensive to maintain and manage. Despite these companies investing heavily in technology, people, and infrastructure, their employees are unable to effectively access the data they need to efficiently run their businesses or activate data to make intelligent and innovative business decisions. In addition, most of these organizations are also experiencing a dramatic increase in data volumes and complexity due to digital transformation.  As companies seek greater agility and flexibility demanded by today�s digitalized and highly disruptive economy, they are turning to cloud infrastructures. By accessing a data warehouse platform integrated within a cloud-based ecosystem, companies can flexibly access and pay for capabilities on demand integrated with the elasticity of cloud. This provides companies the ability to deploy projects and initiatives, with agility and as needed. Given the petabytes of data and the millions of queries executed daily on-premises, we know that the journey to cloud will be a significant endeavor for our customers leading to ecosystems spanning on-premises and cloud for the foreseeable future. With companies pivoting to invest in the cloud, we believe it is essential for these businesses to be able to integrate ecosystems across on-premises and across multi-cloud environments, simplify access to data wherever it resides and accommodate analytics at massive scale and speed. As a result, we believe that the market for our solutions and services is large and growing.

We currently intend to continue to acquire additional facilities, equipment and infrastructure capacity to continue to expand our bitcoin mining operations.  Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a �blockchain,� which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain.

We announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website, SEC filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls, webcasts and social media. We use these channels to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services and other related matters. It is possible that information we post on some of these channels could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media and others interested in Issuer Direct to review the information we post to all our channels, including our social media accounts.  We are a premier provider of communications and compliance technology solutions that are designed to help organizations tell their stories globally.

Platform id. efficiently and effectively helps our customers manage their events when seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. Platform id. consists of several related but distinct communications and compliance modules that companies utilize every quarter.  As our cloud-based subscription business continues to mature, we expect the communications portion of our business to continue to increase over the next several years, both in terms of overall revenue and as compared to the compliance portion of our business. Therefore, as noted below, we have begun to report our revenue as Communications and Compliance revenues rather than Platform   Technology and Services revenues as we have done in the past. Communications revenues grew to 64  of total revenue during 2020, compared to 57  and 45  of our revenue for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, growth from our Communications business was led by the market demands for our events products that were upgraded to handle virtual needs in the industry, as well as our ACCESSWIRE news brand, which drove both subscriptions and pay-as-you-go revenues higher than in prior years.

Through a comprehensive secure messaging service, called Email Encryption  formerly ZixEncrypt , we allow an enterprise to use policy-driven rules to determine which email messages should be sent securely or quarantined for review to comply with regulations or company-defined policies.

We designed our solution to alleviate the recipient�s burden by enabling the delivery of encrypted email automatically and transparently.

Business  OVERVIEW  FalconStor is a data protection leader that enables enterprises to modernize their data backup and archival operations across sites and public clouds, delivering increased data security and providing fast recovery from a ransomware attack while driving down costs by up to 90 percent. A proven technology leader with 47 patents and patent applications, FalconStor has over an exabyte of data under management and is trusted by more than 600 enterprise customers and an ecosystem of managed service providers and resellers worldwide.  Our products are utilized by enterprises and managed service providers across the globe and address two key areas of enterprise data protection; long-term data retention and recovery, and business continuity driven data replication. Our innovative integration with modern cloud-based data storage environments, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, enables our customers to significantly reduce costs, and improve the portability, security, and accessibility of their enterprise data. This accessibility is key in our modern world, where data is not only protected, but also intelligently leveraged to facilitate learning, improve product design, and drive competitive advantage. Our products are software-defined, which means that our technology allows our solutions to be hardware, cloud, and source-data agnostic, giving our customers maximum leverage of existing hardware and software investments.  The enterprise data protection segments in which we focus our attention are critical to the data protection plans of any enterprise. First, the absolute foundation of any enterprise data protection plan is based on long-term data archive, as this segment represents up to 80  of an enterprise�s data according to a 2019 Horizon Information Strategies study. Whether in the form of application databases, documents, emails, or digital media files, an enterprise is mandated to preserve these information assets for lengthy periods of time to fulfill operational, legal, and regulatory requirements. In fact, expanding government and industry regulations continue to increase mandated retention periods, which now exceed one hundred years in certain cases. In addition, beyond fundamental data retention, modern enterprises desire to leverage their long-term archives for strategic analysis and to unlock new revenue streams. As a result, enterprises are challenged with securely and cost effectively managing this data, while also adopting flexible and scalable cloud-based storage environments. Our long-term data retention products enable our customers to reduce their data storage footprint by up to 95  and seamlessly transition data to a wide-array of hybrid-cloud and public-cloud storage, including AWS and Microsoft Azure.  Second, in addition to their long-term data archive foundation, an enterprise must maintain operational data redundancy for specific data assets to ensure near real-time business continuity.

Despite the global headwinds caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and significant investment in headcount additions, Smith Micro continued to thrive in 2020 as the business remained profitable and generated  7.9 million in cash from operations. To solidify our position as a leading white-label solution provider in the family safety market, we purchased the operator business of Circle Media Labs Inc.  �Circle�  - an acquisition that included multiple customer contracts and a perpetual source code license to Circle�s robust parental control software. Our development team spent the majority of 2020 integrating these features into our SafePath� platform, which enabled us to unveil the most comprehensive family safety offering on the market for wireless carriers in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.  The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995.
